#When is an answer plagiarism and should be flagged for moderator attention?

This question is inspired after a long discussion, where no consensus was achieved but nicely summarized by [eis](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/36022846#36022846) in this [chat message](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/36022846#36022846) 

> According to Wikipedia, "The idea [of plagiarism] remains problematic with unclear definitions and unclear rules.", and they give [several definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism#Academia) of which some include intent to benefit from such act and some say it needs to be deliberate. I think it's fair to say that there are different definitions of it, some mention intent explicitly, some don't.

Currently on SE plagiarized answer are handled with custom mod flag, if the flag is correct the [answer is deleted and moderators may suspend the user for a while](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/160072/320339)

The discussion in meta is what is the threshold to consider an answer plagarised, currently in [help center](http://stackoverflow.com/help/referencing)

> Plagiarism - posting the work of others with no indication that it is not your own

Help center continues with how to provide correct attribution (provide a link to the original page or answer, provide the name of the original author)

Fairly often however on StackOverflow we see answer from new user that pass "non" answer like

> `Copied large block of code or entire post from other answer`

> Thanks UserName, that worked great!!!

or

My "instict" on these answer have been to flag as NAA (Not An Answer), passing comment as you can see in screen shot, however the attribution part is not correct since it has copied text from [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21842390/5292302)

This brings up some considerations?

- Is intent to benfit from plagarsim needed?
- *"No indication that it is not your own*", are we more tollerante to new users, hence we don't expect them to know how to provide correct attribution, format etc and we shoulf look at context, when needed we help them to edit and in this case just consider it NAA? 

or

is the correct way to always indicated that they are not providing correct attribution and custom mod flag these NAA answer as plagarsim, skipping the LQP queue.

Please note:
I'm excluding the case where it can be difficult to see the thanks, please help part, hence it is more helpful to in any case raise a custom mod flag to avoid review queue and help moderator to evaluate it correctly.
