#Do we need "intent to benefit" from plagiarize to define an answer as plagiarism?

This question is inspired after a long discussion, where no consensus was achieved but nicely summarized by [eis](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/36022846#36022846) in this [chat message](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/36022846#36022846) 

> According to Wikipedia, "The idea [of plagiarism] remains problematic with unclear definitions and unclear rules.", and they give [several definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism#Academia) of which some include intent to benefit from such act and some say it needs to be deliberate. I think it's fair to say that there are different definitions of it, some mention intent explicitly, some don't.

Currently on SE plagiarized answer are handled with custom mod flag, if the flag is correct the answer is deleted and user can even be suspended if he/she have multiple instances of this behavior.

Does an answer need **intent to benefit** from plagiarize to merit the label " plagiarism" or should any answer without correct attribution even if we evaluate it as **no intent to benefit** be considered as plagiarism.

On Stack Overflow it's fairly common with these kind of "non" answers.

> `Copied large block of code or entire post from other answer`

> Thanks UserName, that worked great!!!  

or

> `Copied large block of code or entire post from other answer`

> Stuff not work me... plz help quick, tanks in advantage.

This question is not merely philosophical, linguistic “How do we define plagiarism” since it also boil down to action that we should take on these posts.

These Not An Answer that with some good will do not show “Intent to benefit” from the copied content, do we consider them as plagiarized content anyway (since they do not have correct attribution) and should we always raise a moderator flag?, or do we not consider it as plagiarized content and only an Not An Answer flag should be raised letting the review queue handle it?

Please note:
I'm excluding the case where it can be difficult to see the thanks, please help part, hence it is more helpful to in any case raise a custom mod flag to avoid review que and help moderator to evaluate it correctly.
