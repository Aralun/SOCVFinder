#Do we need "intent to benfit" from plagarize to define an answer as plagarsim?

This question is inspried after along discussion, where no consus was achieved but nicely summerzied by [eis](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/36022846#36022846) in this [chat message](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/36022846#36022846) 

> According to Wikipedia, "The idea [of plagiarism] remains problematic with unclear definitions and unclear rules.", and they give [several definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism#Academia) of which some include intent to benefit from such act and some say it needs to be deliberate. I think it's fair to say that there are different definitions of it, some mention intent explicitly, some don't.

Currently on SE plargarized answer are handled with custom mod flag indicating from which answer it was plagrarzied. If the flag is correct the answer is deleted and user can even be suspended if he/she have multiple instanzes of this behaviour.

Does an answer need **intent to benfit** from plagarize to merit the label "plagrised" or should any answer without correct attribution even if we evalutate it as **no intent to benfint** be flagged as plagarsim.

Note on StackOver flow it's farily common with these kind of answers.

This question boils down to, these Non Answers that with some good will do not show intent to benfit from the plagarize content merly incorrectly attibuting what they like to thank or ask help about, do we consider them as plagarized content anyway (since they do not have correct attribution) and should always a moderator flag be rasied or do we not consider it as plagarized content and only an Not An Answer flag should be rasied letting the review que handle it.

I'm excluding the case where it can be difficult to see the thanks, please help part, hence it is more helpful to in an case raise a custom mod flag to avoid review que and help moderator to evaluate it correctly.
