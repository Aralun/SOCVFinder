# Give some credits to the Hammers

A good duplicated post in it self is not a problem, it can even merit upvotes, but it needs to be closed as
duplicate to not make it difficult to find the best answers.


Duplicate post on SO is a major problem, not only does it get harder to find the best answers, it also creates tension between user searching for duplicates and users answering duplicates. 

SE has acknowledge the [problem of duplicates](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/334344/5292302) and as our first defense we have our hammers.

The hammer not only quicky close the question, they also saves review time from 4 other users, however these hammers receive no credit for thier work, instead on regualar basis they get downvotes from angry OP (if lucky more then 3 down-votes).
