#The close vote system is completly broke what impact does it and will have on Stack Overflow

I'm one of the janitors on SO, monitoring questions, answers and comments with the hope of doing the community good, keeping Stack overflow useful for future visitors. 

The community and it's moderator are good at handling flags on answers and comment. 
What is flag is handled and in most cases appropriate actions are taken to keep SO clean for future vistors, 

However the close votes system is completly broke.

I will not spend to much time demostrating this since it most certainly is common knowledge, it's enough to take a look at the close vote review queue is around 9K and the reason that
it's not increasing is simple because the reviews we scatter around on posts age away. Yeah much of the work the 
community has done goes to waste to keep the number down. Furthermore in low-traffic tag if you do not have >3K almost all
your flags will be completly useless since they also will marked with aged away.

The site is also flooded with duplicated and not even our hammers can keep it clean, there is nothing that encourage them to do it and
they will only find thier questions down-voted (people get upset that they pointed them to the solution). 

It's so broke that there is no simple solution, certainly increasing cv votes for a few flowers will not solve this issue.

My question is: What impact will this have on SO in the future?

Personaly I move between these 2 radical ideas, hoping that the first one is right.

1). We rate content with votes, so it's not a problem, the close vote system could be partly or eniterly removed.

2). SO is beeing poluted and we are not able clean it, slowly we bury what is gold with a tick layer of dirt, making SO less useful everyday.

What ever is the truth, I feel that it is time that the Community and SE, acknowledge that we have a system that is not working and that it's time for some serious action.
