#The close vote system is completely broke what impact does it and will have on Stack Overflow?

I'm one of the janitors on SO, monitoring questions, answers and comments with the hope of doing the community good, keeping Stack overflow useful for future visitors. 

The community and its moderator are good at handling flags on answers and comment.  The flags are handled in relative short time period and in most cases, appropriate actions are taken to keep SO clean for future visitors.

However the close votes system is **completely broke**.

I will not spend to much time demonstrating this since it probably is common knowledge, most of us can see the close vote review queue. Currently the queue is around 9K and the reason that it's not increasing is simple because the reviews we scatter around on posts age away. Yeah much of the work the community has done goes to waste to keep the number down. Furthermore in low-traffic tag if you do not have >3K almost all your flags will be useless since they also will marked with aged away.

The site is also flooded with duplicates and not even our hammers can keep it clean, there is nothing that encourage them to do it and
they will only find their questions down-voted (people get upset that they pointed them to the solution). 

It's so broke that there is no simple solution, certainly minor tweaks [increasing cv votes](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/319131/1-2-3-test-let-s-increase-the-number-of-reviews-close-votes-for-science) for a few flowers will not solve this issue.

My question is: ***What impact will this have on SO in the future?***

 1. We rate content with votes, so it's not a problem, the close vote system could be partly or entirely removed.

 2. SO is being polluted and we are not able clean it, slowly we bury what is gold with a thick layer of dirt, making SO less useful every day.

Whatever is the truth, I feel that it is time that the Community and SE, acknowledge that we have a system that is broke and that it is time for some serious action in either direction.

<sup>Can someone explain to me why SE do not invest in this, after all it success comes from the high quality content</sup>
