#To flag, or not to flag- that is the question:

Currently, we are running a StackApp, [called Heat Detector](http://stackapps.com/questions/7001/), using both regular expressions and NLP (Natural Language Processing) on all your comments. The goal of this project is to identify automatically offensive comments left throughout Stack Overflow. Earlier this year, [we asked for a dump of abusive comments](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/326494/can-i-have-a-dump-of-rude-abusive-comments) and, together with manual classifying on _a lot_ of comments, we now have a fairly working application.

The flame-out comments from new users are often easy to classify but, everyday, we see a continuous flow of borderline rude comments from the regular users of Stack Overflow. Here's a sample: 

> This shows remarkably little effort.

> please go back to reading some basic C# tutorials for beginners

> Wow, you didn't even bother to write a proper sentence, why should anyone invest any of his time to answer this junk? 

> STFW. First result of googling react rails: github.com/reactjs/react-rails 

> my eyessssss they burn

> This question was generated by a random word generator, right? 

> Your inability to comprehend causes anger in you. Use your brain please.

> Ok. That's nice. Good luck with that. Did you have a programming question? This site is for questions, not a place to dump your christmas wish list

> I thought we were supposed to learn how to calculate triangle area&#39;s in middle school. apparently not...

> if you are only a beginner, first read some books and documentation. Then improve your English, because it is really bad (don&#39;t want to insult you). Then search in the English part of the Net for the things I wrote before. And use your head

> Stop being lazy, stop cheating, and do your own homework.

> But Object Pascal is not your sixties language. If you don't know much about a language (and that you don't is obvious) why comment on it, and even post that as answer? FWIW, you can learn all these things and a lot more with Object Pascal. Encapsulation is one of the most important tenets of OO, BTW. And no, you are not being helpful, nor are you answering the question. This answer should be deleted. 

> They&#39;re going to ignore you either way. You&#39;re just annoying the rest of us.

> Please don&#39;t encourage people who don&#39;t bother to make the slightest effort.

> No. Please stop bothering people to do your homework for you. This isn&#39;t what Stack Overflow is for.

> Your question looks as crap. You should improve your text formatting. Here is a quick tutorial for that.

The [be-nice](http://stackoverflow.com/help/be-nice) policy states fairly clearly that "If you don't have time to say something politely, just leave it for someone who does". Furthermore, reading all of these Meta posts:

 - FAQ on comments: [Etiquette for posting civil and informative comments](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/138173/etiquette-for-posting-civil-and-informative-comments).
 - [When should comments be flagged as “not constructive”?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/186308/when-should-comments-be-flagged-as-not-constructive).

it seems fairly clear that these should be flagged as "offensive" or "non-constructive". However the comments above are a selection of comments with declined non-constructive flags, comments by high-rep users and one is a comment from a moderator (later edited to be less offensive).

***Should such comments be included in the "bad feed" of a classifier or not? Do we want to hunt down such comments by an automatic system looking for rudeness?***

Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br/>
The slings and arrows of outrageous comments,<br/>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br/>
And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep-<br/> 
No more-and by a sleep to say we end.
