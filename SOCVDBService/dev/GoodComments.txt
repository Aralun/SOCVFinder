Regarding your second comment question Hardcoding numbers describing data will kick you in the groin the moment you want to change something about the data Now when it comes to C arrays important only arrays not pointers set to arrays you can actually determine the number of elements in it using the sizeof operator However it d make much more sense for you to write a OBJ loader There s hardly any reason to link data into a programs source except for super simple small auxiliary data | 1.6464598256109038E-16 | 0.9999999999999998
