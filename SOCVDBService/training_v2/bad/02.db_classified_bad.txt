@Tom You convinced me. John deserved the downvotes and I shouldn&#39;t have said anything in his defense. In fact, I should have humiliated him myself.
my god please stop thats decent annoying
I take it that the person who downvoted is just an idiot then....
@NickBull why being such a bad person? he wants to learn, let him be... in programming there&#39;s no such thing as &quot;dumb questions&quot; imo.
@Dima Idiot, how can you dare to complain me about the code if reformatting it will eliminate the issue? You won&#39;t spend time if issue is gone. But it won&#39;t help to explain it. I am asking those who will do it.
i know that idiot. read this
Listen everyone who clicked minus, my mum has just told me you all must support iceland, shame on you all.
SO Haters gonna hate, people calm down, newbies doesn&#39;t know about anything.
Why are you wasting your time here then. Go find new post
No problem ;D. I&#39;ll delete the coment. I was just thinking, WTF is he drunk? xD..
For god sakes, first that&#39;s not a timer, but a fucking stopwatch. Second, GOOGLE it, you&#39;ll find it a zillion % chance.
Ok. Hope you guys are happy for harming my rep. Bye.
Hey, watch the way you speak to me, asshole.
You mean the idiot before me, right? Because he is the one that insulted me first.
Very nice, you delete my comments but not his despite he is insulting me. You dont play very fair, do you?
mother fuckers who down vote this question.... son of bitch go to hell
Maybe he is a bad Googler? lol
@sgarcia thats the msot stupidest thing i have ever heard in my life
i&#39;m not that interested in earling points and commenting. i&#39;m content with wreaking havoc in my own way and re-creating my profile when the admins get butthurt and cut me off..
delete this comment butthurt admins i repost it all day
Downvoters: you suck. The accepted answer with positive votes is barely an answer at all in addition to being flat out wrong...
Why do people like u still exist?
It did work finnaly, i don&#39;t know what the fuck did happen earlier but, thanks! :D
@Anant wtf, you deleted your  comments,,,according to the rules, you are a pussy....
Go sleep , man..
The person who is reporting my comment as spam is my biggest enemy
This deserves a big LOL!
fuck your own cunt asshole
Fucking Intellij. Just costed me a few hours.
Go away. You&#39;re so immature. Obviously I&#39;m looking for a legitimate answer. Like WHY it&#39;s broken and how long until it&#39;s fixed. Did it ever occur to you that someone from Google or Galaxy7.
When I&#39;m listening to melancholy music and I read questions like this one I legitimately feel sad.
You&#39;re gonna be massively downvoted so I&#39;d suggest you delete your answer as it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE QUESTION.
comments must be comment. DON&#39;T YOU THINK YOUR ANSWER HAS NO MEAN FOR OP
@Kabeer Thats bullshit in a form which couldn&#39;t be more clear. When you build applications beyond the proof-of-concept scope you have to think about operational advantages and I can tell you, running mongo in production is a PITA. 
Go fuck yourself retard
notice how my retarded answer was the only one that got downvoted, cus my name is poopbagel. little experiment  :P
It&#39;s always happy hour somewhere... and this guy is there
you think I didn&#39;t know that command you idiot?
Obviously I don&#39;t know how to do it if i&#39;m here smart ass
@Vucko Shut the fuck up if your not going to help
note to people responding to my question: it so happens that i can&#39;t magically pull an understanding of c out of my ass

It&#39;s just one of the utterly unbelievable things about Apple that they haven&#39;t fixed this.  That, and the fucked-up graphics cards in MBPs.
destroction ass!!!!!

Of coufse can code asynchoslu, but rezlize fuckon fo support
YOU NEED TO CREATE A QUESTION IT IS POSSIBLE TO ANSWER.
Did I say that I need your care?! Funny. I&#39;m tired of duplicated people like you so it is normal that you do not care and neither do I. Your comments to me are nonsense, let alone your down-vote. If you have a good point to throw, you are welcome oth..
hey guys... wtf
Not sure why the down vote. I know the title sucks but I couldn&#39;t be more descriptive than that could I? The rest of the post seems clear and concise.
gradle and studio suck so bad.. eclipse was heaven compared to all this nonsense..
sounds like you need to go to your boss and then them that you overrated your experiences / skills when you had the interview.. good luck
shut the fuck up
What a funny kid ;)
@ishan Please don&#39;t encourage people who don&#39;t bother to make the slightest effort.

fuck you and fuck stack exchange ...your the rude prick who came in trolling...they need to start banning dicks like you it destroys this platform keep people like you around
get some friends
android studio overall does a lot of bullshit that cant be turned off..
... buy a book.
Are you kidding me? <code>0.25 == 6A</code> . Why? Because Coldfusion thinks 0.25 is a quarter of a day, and so is 6 AM. I think that a big WTF is in order here.
@EhsanAkbar you can pretend that you&#39;re polite and I&#39;m not, but I saw your comment that told me to &quot;shut up&quot; before you removed it.
to some it all up YOUR NO HELP please delete your post. i take a lot of offence to it
go to hell, 3 years ago I was in this community it wasn&#39;t like this ...
post as answer asshole
@EICaptainv2.0 Haha... Dont try to rescue yourself. Do you think john farkerson is a fool to help me with the precise updated code. Lol grow up man
Well, first of all I don&#39;t need lectures from you - moron.
I have one more question. Why are all you guys such assholes?
@Claies , I don&#39;t asking anyone to write for me the easiest custom logic in the world. Please don&#39;t jump to ridiculous conclusions.
did you even read the question? SO points do not convert into real life money so stop making pointless edit suggestions and stop clogging my post with your useless non contributions
@RobertLongson You people are really sick! You shouting out my post is duplicated... If i delete my post, you shouting out I cannot delete duplicated post...
Lol too much aggressive people for nieve to no reason tbh. You guys need to be more mature and to say something helpful for what I asked (topic) or better move on and leave without repling at all instead of being so butthurt for asking for help dudes grow up cuz I am not gonna take part of ur brain for asking for bit of script cuz I am sure it won&#39;t be that of huge script... done here
Guyes why are you down voting i&#39;m asking a question which i dont know,if you too dont know the answer just shut the fcuk up and dont downvote .. if you know the answer reply back
Go read a C++ book.
So many fuckheads here just voting a question without answering. Thats the new stackoverflow? &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know the anwser, my life sucks, but I am an idiot so I am voting.&quot;
What part of the documentation don&#39;t you understand?
I have one more question. Why are all you guys such assholes? I know i&#39;m an idiot. But why do you guys have to always leave snobby and rude comments on all the questions that are asked by the beginners. By the way when i said &quot;C sharp&quot; i mean&#39;t to say &quot;C#&quot; and things can be both Relatively advanced and simple textured, haven&#39;t  you ever heard of Minecraft? one more thing, how do I delete my account?
@aristos If you do not understand the homework, perhaps you should have listened when your teacher explained it.
Do you really think your answer might help on a 5 year old question?
