Formatted the html code I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THIS YOU SAY
whoever down voted, be a big boy, explain why
@User TL;DR: &quot;Too Long; Don&#39;t Read&quot;
Seems like a home work!
man, someone is on a downvote spree this morning :P

As @cricket_007 suggested, word detection can be extremely difficult (often requiring machine learning, and AI algorithms) and introduce a whole wealth of natural language ambiguities, your data source should be fixed.

Well, you don&#39;t have to use a mocking framework. You can always create mock classes yourself! And honestly: if your hands are really handcuffed like this; and you are not allowed to do the things that make sense; you better turn back to your manager ...
Then you can&#39;t read from it.  As a workaround, and depending on how much work you want to put in, and how hacky you want the solution to be, you could look in to writing a test application using TestStack from White (<a href="http://www.teststack.net...

Have you seen the uptime of MY box yet? ;) But seriously, there is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime--" rel="nofollow">no guarantee</a> that nanoTime starts at 0: <code>The value returned represents nanoseconds since some fixed but arbitrary origin time (perhaps in the future, so values may be negative). The same origin is used by all invocations of this method in an instance of a Java virtual machine; other virtual machine instances are likely to use a different origin.</code> So it wraps every 292 years, but potentially much earlier than 292 years after booting up.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t find anyone looking for sending an email without password authentication&quot; -- that is because mail servers require passwords to be able to send email, at least from arbitrary IP addresses. Otherwise, spammers would be very happy.

First you have to get to know the OwinContext.Request.Query well enough to find something that makes it feel inadequate. I googled &quot;OwinContex.Request.Query flaws&quot; but didn&#39;t find anything good to work with.

nothing to do with php. it just walks your envelope down to the street corner and tosses it into the mailbox (smtp server). if hotmail doesn&#39;t get the mail, that&#39;s not php&#39;s problem. it&#39;s the postal service&#39;s (e.g. spam folder/filters)

The filter is just a doctrine query so it has no real connection to the flushing process.

The second would recognise that the <code>deletedAt</code> has been set previously and will ignore actually delete - ass you can see here <a href="https://github.com/Atlantic18/DoctrineExtensions/blob/master/lib/Gedmo/SoftDeleteable/SoftDeleteableListener.php#L63-L71" rel="nofollow">github.com/Atlantic18/DoctrineExtensions/blob/master/lib/Gedmo/&hellip;</a>.

Surely even compilers for low-level/embedded systems are smart enough to optimize a division by a power of two to a bit shift?

This looks like a thedailywtf.com-type approach for downloading a document via http. Different operating systems use different libraries for implementing HTTP. Since you did not indicate which operating system you are using, no answer is possible. But one can always create a socket(), connect(), send an HTTP request, and retrieve the HTTP response manually. HTTP is very simple.

To add to Andy&#39;s comment - if you don&#39;t override <code>hashCode</code> in a way that&#39;s consistent with <code>equals</code>, expect bad things to happen in potentially unexpected places.

<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/jerk.html" rel="nofollow">Jerk is the rate of change of acceleration over time, just as velocity if the rate of change in position over time, and as acceleration is the rate of change of velocity over time.</a>  Because you have a maximum acceleration constraint, this implies that the acceleration is changing over time.  Thus, jerk is how fast it is changing, and a value that you will set (I&#39;d recommend making it specific to different enemies).   And as for your acceleration not exceeding a constraint level, I am including that in the answer I am typing right now.
omg you found my mistake, thanks to you. really stupid but i sit here and wondered since 1 hour xD
Oh right; so jerk is a different way of expressing &quot;car reaches 100mph in 2 seconds&quot; - but rather than using time, you use a rate... is that right? That could work... I suppose! I&#39;d have to see it in action. Anyway I&#39;m way overdue for sleep I&#39;m afraid. Looking forward to checking-in in about 8 hours. Good luck!
Ok, I am starting to figure out how to control it.  You have to use the check boxes.  Argh.  WTF does it let you even edit the code it presents?  Anywas, thank you for providing a correct answer to my question (I still hate computers, though).
Mostly, car reaches 100 mph is super broad, only mentioning a time and final velocity magnitude.  For example, lets say that the car&#39;s acceleration from 0 m/s^2 to 20 m/s^2 in 3 seconds.  How did it do this?  At 2 seconds, was its acceleration still 0 and then it jumped to 3?  Jerk describes how it increased (or in this case, a constant jerk value will make it so that the acceleration increases linearly with time).  Likewise, this linear accleration increase implies that the velocity increase will be parabolic, and positional change for the car would vary with time^3.
Holy crap that was beautiful haha/

You must at least tag the code language you&#39;re using and ask a more detailed question. I know it&#39;s Java but most people don&#39;t and you should give more details about the technology you&#39;re using.
read carefully the answer below, you say you know all that, and you need to create a random matrix,  but you don&#39;t use <code>rand</code> or any other function for random numbers in your code. don&#39;t expect others to do your homework if you don&#39;t try to do it yourself
Looks like this code is not nearly enough to actually investigate your issue. Also beware that your formatting has cause the automated systems to consider this spam so you have a second reason to edit.

All of this is due to the behavior of the underlying Date.parse() trying to follow ISO 8601. When the date string follows the yyyy-mm-dd format, it&#39;s assumed to be ISO 8601 with implicit UTC 00:00. When the string deviates from the format (e.g. mm-dd-yyyy or slash instead of hyphen), it falls back to the looser parser according to RFC 2822 which uses local time when the timezone is absent. Admittedly, this will all be quite arcane to an average person.
@Desperado who said it was Darshan who downvoted? Please don&#39;t judge people if you don&#39;t know. I find Darshan&#39;s question a legitimate one.
Please don&#39;t tag-spam. This has nothing to do with <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%23">c#</a> or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/asp.net-mvc">asp.net-mvc</a>.
use a proper installer, don&#39;t write your own.
Interesting. I guess it depends on who your students are. My students (humanities) need to know how to drive the car, not how to take it apart and put it back together.
Michael&#39;s answer makes full sense to me, so I don&#39;t understand the someone&#39;s down-vote. Up-voting back on.
So you think your dropping of requirements will make people send you code? Sorry, won&#39;t happen.
Internet Archive to the rescue: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160703165415/https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html" rel="nofollow">web.archive.org/web/20160703165415/https://&hellip;</a> This is still a lazy answer so I downvoted.
@RareKyurem this is too broad and the question is badly presented. We can&#39;t help or assist those who make it hard or impossible.
ping one of us if you get anything. Moving on
You should disclose you have a personal interest in the link mentioned. If you don&#39;t do that, it fits the criteria for SPAM.
@RudyVelthuis Every class descended from <code>TInterfacedObject</code> is destined to be used via interfaces because of the lifetime policy that it implements. If you want a different lifetime policy then you should choose a different base class. And you
Do read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/promotion">How to not be a spammer</a>.
Really you should have explained a lot better your problem. And downvoting just because we cannot understand your unexplained problem is just silly
If helpful, vote up. That&#39;s how you say thanks around here.
What don&#39;t you understand? Why did you write this code?
@mishamosher pls have this as an answer! this captured a bunch of cases (not sure if all)
Meanwhile anonymous downvotes without explanation. I believe they haven&#39;t even understood the question.
gif isnt white :(
-fpic would be an option for a compiler, like gcc. if you&#39;re writing asm, you&#39;d have to write the pic stuff yourself.
This is ridiculous, no matter how hard I try im on the edge of getting banned ( for some unclear reasons )
visit <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Percentage-in-Java" rel="nofollow">wikihow.com/Calculate-Percentage-in-Java</a> you might get some idea.
OP expects &quot;Sublime Text 3&quot; from path &quot;C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3\sublime_text.exe&quot; So I don&#39;t think your answer is the OP&#39;s intention
here is the last link : <a href="https://www.unlocktheinbox.com/mail-tester/SUcC6jd9RyY=/" rel="nofollow">unlocktheinbox.com/mail-tester/SUcC6jd9RyY=</a>  SPF seems to be okay now, but emails are still marked as spam :(
I don&#39;t think doing any simple computation every two hours is going to waste anything significantly.
If I were you I wouldn&#39;t let my threads stay up that late. I always put mine to bed by 7:30, 8:00 at the latest
Just cut and paste the text I will format it. Pictures are barely of any use. In general, very annoying on the stack. Because people cut and paste your text to make their answer. So a picture is like a waste of time.
Lol @AshwinNair you deleted yours I deleted mine :)
It&#39;s worth mentioning that <b>a lot</b> of e-mail clients (I&#39;d dare to say the majority, even) will not support Javascript - not to mention the risk of the e-mail getting marked as SPAM or rejected altogether. I would advise redirecting them to a website doing this, rather than including a form in the e-mail itself.   Oh, and I just noticed..- <code>action=&quot;..&#47;mail.php&quot;</code> won&#39;t really work when sent in an e-mail - if the form itself works to begin with (which, <b>it can</b>, but likely <b>won&#39;t</b>).
Great. I&#39;ve painted myself into weird generic inheritance corners over and over and over, so it really helped when someone explained the alternative to me.
A little advice... don&#39;t write an preface if you want your question answered. People don&#39;t want to read a story to answer your question. This will probably help you get more questions answers.
You&#39;re lucky. I was about to go to bed. I&#39;ve send you a reply through email.
I had this problem on some of my wordpress websites. I was surprised that no one has mentioned this on the wordpress forum. I can&#39;t upvote enough for this.
You too boss...tacked on a +1 for you. Who actually focused on his stuff while I was off in SC somewhere.
@Oriol Let&#39;s not go to deep.. <code>+0 === -0</code> alright.. This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7223359/are-0-and-0-the-same">article</a> might help.
It is not enough. One cannot understand where <code>CopyFileW(Path, TPath, 0)</code> fails without seeing everything. I suggest you to debug your program instead of asking here.
They are not. One is GET and second PUT. Router should distinguish such obvious difference, don&#39;t You think?
The problem here is that we have a lot off functions that need to be present in draw and setup. So passing them one by one, is not an solution. We could pass them ass object but then we are back at square one. Thanks for all your thought Peter. I will rethink the idea and maybe we have to go for a global scope.
To the person who downvoted : <code>LEAVE A COMMENT</code> why !
If you explicitly tag a question with iText, and your question is not about iText at all, it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that iText people aren&#39;t too happy about it. What you do, is called tag spamming, and I am going to edit your question to remove your spam.
@MatthieuM. <code>OsString</code> has <i>no</i> inherent relationship to C strings.  For example, on Windows, <code>OsString</code> is WTF-8, whilst C strings are <i>guaranteed</i> to be in some <i>other</i> encoding (since Win32 doesn&#39;t know what WTF
please ass the packages to your code snipped
Actually my professor talked about the precision problems. Don&#39;t worry he is a great professor ahah
@Pshemo I agree. I just don&#39;t like to pass on the opportunity to tell people not to use regular expressions for every string processing task :)
@Zabuza We want to teach him to always specify an encoding, so when the encoding is different than he thinks he doesn&#39;t have to come back to SO with a new question about why his file reading doesn&#39;t work. Either answer properly or don&#39;t answer
Only when you answer your own question. I think the restriction is there to stop people posting a bunch of questions and immediately answering them to game the reputation system.
Why on earth would you call a user <code>$data</code>? You make things more confusing for yourself and others if you come up with arbitrary variable names.
just realized that slut is an extremely bad parameter when posting this on an english site, to my defence, its &quot;end&quot; in swedish, hope that wont stop you if you got any idea for me...
@Hack-R sorry I know i added that to answer your question. actually I don&#39;t care even if they remove my question. the only thing I don&#39;t like is that some people are just BLAH, just close their eyes and even don&#39;t read a question and down vote
@nmnsud The OP <i>appears</i> to want to get email addresses for the purposes of spamming. Unless they provide a reasonable justification for what appears to be their intent, do you <i>want</i> to help increase email spam?
why down vote i want to know? I don&#39;t know how these people live, just by down voting without any reason.
Over 16 millions chars? This is enough for a book ;)
It&#39;s sad that users don&#39;t lose rep for downvoting questions too.
Stop wasting GUIDs! We have only 5,316,911,983,139,663,491,615,228,241,121,400,000 of them!
I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t understand the chaining of for cols in zip() for col in cols? I understand &quot;for cols in zip&quot; but don&#39;t get the double recursivity there... Would you mind developping, please?
Just put the items in an ObservableCollection, bind it in the XAML, and get on with your life. You don&#39;t get any bonus points for punishing yourself by doing things wrong. But if you&#39;re absolutely determined to waste your own time, have you tried raising PropertyChanged for the collection property? Or are you not even binding it?
Holy sh**t -_- i&#39;m so tired, thank a lot...
