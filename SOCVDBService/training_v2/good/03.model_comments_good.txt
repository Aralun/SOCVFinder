FYI You should use 24 hour format <code>H</code> or else how do you know the difference between 8:45 in the morning and 8:45 at night?  Also no need for the <code>a</code> as the db column doesn&#39;t use that.
You can set <code>link.href</code> property..

Declare the function before using it.
Sometimes you inherit bad table/column names from those who have gone before.  It&#39;s just something you have to deal with.   You can put double quotes around a column name to allow mixed case names.   It may make the query seem a bit cleaner as it doesn&#39;t look exactly like a keyword.
everything (my answer included) is a sledgehammer approach. If dependencies aren&#39;t tracked properly, you basically have no option but to do a full rebuild.
Hav you counted how often your loop in <code>abc()</code> is being traversed altogether with aa = 1 and with aa = 2 (by any thread)? Once you have, come back and modify your question. Hint: Your threads don&#39;t <i>share</i> any work
<code>tput sgr0</code> is used to reset terminal attributes like display color. <code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code> is executed <i>before</i> the prompt is displayed, and the <code>tput</code> command is presumably used to undo changes made earlier in the prompt (but not shown).

Welcome to Stack Overflow! It sounds like you may need to learn how to use a debugger to step through your code. With a good debugger, you can execute your program line by line and see where it is deviating from what you expect. This is an essential tool if you are going to do any programming.

remove the semicolon on your while loop line it should just be <code>while (beans &gt; 0)</code> Edit: Actually I see this on multiple while loops, there shouldn&#39;t be semicolons on any of those. You don&#39;t see any output because none of your if statements will evaluate to true at the end if your while loop doesn&#39;t run for enough iterations to make any of the conditions true. That semicolon is just ending the while part of your main loop so it will run no more than once.
Why <code>b3: &#39;1&#39;</code>.?

Your main question doesn&#39;t make sense to me. It returns 1 because push returns the length of the array you&#39;ve inserted element to. It does push element to the array, but as you&#39;re logging the return of push, and not the list1 you see only 1. If you&#39;ll log <code>console.log(list1.push(&quot;a&quot;), list1)</code> you&#39;ll see that that your array has <code>a</code> in it
Have you looked at the documentation for <code>Array.prototype.push</code>?
I just worked it out went with <code>df.sort_values(&#39;Key1&#39;, ascending=True, inplace=True)</code>
@iNoob, you can do it in between the data frames creation and writing to file with <code>df = df.sort_values(by=[&#39;key1&#39;,&#39;key2&#39;])</code>
You could also use <code>ObservableCollection</code> instead of <code>List</code>, it already has several events related to data changes.

Kotlin made the choice to support implicit SAM interface conversion to functions only for Java interfaces. Not for Kotlin interfaces. I agree that this hurts readability in some cases. Type aliases will come in the next version (AFAIR). JetBrains will then see if that fixes the problem of if conversion of Kotlin interfaces should be allowed. There&#39;s a feature request for that: <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-7770" rel="nofollow">youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-7770</a>. In the meantime, I would just use <code>(T) -&gt; Boolean</code> in the signatures. Hopefully refactoring the code with type aliases won&#39;t be too hard.

Once these indices are collected into two separate lists, use <code>sapply</code> to draw the lines on top of the scatter plot. You will probably want to add the col argument to control the colors.

technically this is a variant of a pivot query, and mysql doesn&#39;t support them. the workarounds get very ugly, very fast. if you only EVER need to check for 1/2/3, then it&#39;s not totally horrible, but the workarounds can NOT handle 1/2/3/.../n arbitrary transformations. you&#39;re probably better off implementing the counting logic in client-side code, and just doing a conventional <code>select * from ...</code> query.

What exactly do you think is wrong with the code that needs to be picked up by SA?
something like that happened to me when I had plyr package loaded
<code>O(n * log n)</code> is a subset of <code>O(n * (log n)^2)</code>, so every algorithm with a time complexity of <code>O(n * log n)</code> also has a time complexity of <code>O(n * (log n)^2)</code>.
You forgot a quote somewhere.
&quot;I want to be able to get a pointer that refers to the void foo() method inside the a1 object&quot; You must understand that there is no such thing so you cannot get it. There is only one <code>A::foo</code> method in the memory that serves all objects of type (class) <code>A</code>. That&#39;s why you <b>must</b> specify object to which you want to apply this method (for example in the form <code>a1-&gt;foo()</code> - unless that method is static. To answer question &quot;how can we make a difference&quot; - method get&#39;s &quot;hidden&quot; parameter <code>this</code> by which you know to what instance current call is made
no, that&#39;d probably be the most efficient. just be careful, because you WILL be dealing with a string, and may run into trouble with other functions that expect text strings, not binary strings. e.g. something that mis-interprets a sequence of your bytes as a unicode multibyte character.
I&#39;ve already used this method successfully to create a cache of random bytes to be used on demand.. It should work just fine.

Ah wait the &#39;iterative&#39; you talk about is the fixed point method? If yes (as it appears in your original code), then you can&#39;t use it on function f to find its roots as it is. if you want x such that f(x)=0, then you need to find a function g such that f(x)=0 writes g(x)=x and then apply your fixed point research on this function g and not f.
I&#39;ve looked into this in the past, and I find it&#39;s just easier to combine a <code>http.FileServer</code> with <code>tsc -w</code> that will automatically compile the files and dump them to the static folder.

@Remy - +1 for that crucial observation.  I think the fact that a 50MB XML file results in 600MB of application memory use is also a strong indicator that it is the processing of the XML by the application that is primarily responsible for the excessive memory use, rather than the XML itself.  TO provide any assistance in that area of course, we would need to know what the app is <i>doing</i> with that XML.

Like I said, trying to make move assignment thread safe is conceptually flawed. Something that might be applicable to you would be something similar to the <code>swap</code> method on the <code>std::vector</code>. If you want to use a CAS operation to achieve thread safety, I would ask that as a separate question in SO, otherwise you could just use a <code>std::mutex</code> and <code>std::lock_guard</code> to achieve thread safety, but you will then need to consider thread safety of all internals (and possibly your iterators depending on the level of functionality you are trying to implement).

No problem. It&#39;s just one of those lessons everyone learns where they now start to name variable and controls properly instead of <code>foo1</code>, <code>foo2</code>, <code>foo3</code>, etc. Also a single breakpoint and some debugging would have shown the issue  ;)

It would make more sense if the signature was <code>int disjoint(const int a[],  int n1, const int b[], int n2)</code> and then drop &quot;no changing the array&quot;.
Please refer to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match" rel="nofollow">developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/&hellip;</a> for the usage of match. It is used to match a regular expression and returns a boolean value.
Don&#39;t use a delegate&#39;s BeginInvoke() method to implement threading, a <i>bool</i> is not a synchronization primitive.  There are better ways to do this, how to correctly handle this for a BackgroundWorker is covered in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732361/17034">this Q+A</a>.
most likely a z-index issue, something is covering the link
Just use a sieve, and scan the result.
Posting the code in which &quot;currently having problems in getting all the combinations for comparison ...&quot; would help clarify your goal/issue.
Fair enough ... ;-) start it with redirecting <code>stdout</code> to the bit-bucket: <code>.&#47;a.out 1&gt;&#47;dev&#47;null</code>
Use an IDE or pick a different text editor.
Many thanks....
I believe you wont need it...
@BryceDrew This is a personal repository and not shared with anyone, so no worries there. Sorry to be a bit daft, but I am new to git and I obviously don&#39;t know the commands well enough. My local repository is in E:/Code/Code.Website1. The local branch is &quot;development&quot;. The remote repository&#39;s branch is also &quot;development&quot;. So would it be: <code>git push ~&#47;Code&#47;Code.Website1&#47;development development:development -f</code>?
What you&#39;ll want to do is stop event propagation when the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> (or a div containing it) is clicked, so it doesn&#39;t bubble up to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> where the body click handler would act on the event and hide the form.  Check jquery&#39;s <code>event.stopPropagation()</code> and <code>event.stopImmediatePropagation()</code>
I&#39;m going to upvote you since you put me exactly where I needed to be.  However, in my environment, lookupField.LookupList was a string, specifically the list Title.
<code>&quot;shell&quot;: &quot;bash&quot;</code> is not a valid <a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/build_systems/exec.html#exec-command-arguments" rel="nofollow">build system option</a>. It should either be <code>true</code> or not present. The items in the <code>&quot;cmd&quot;</code> array need to be individually surrounded by quotes, and separated by commas. If you set the executable bit on your <code>.sh</code> file, you don&#39;t need to call it with <code>sh</code>, you just need to put the name of the file there.
Right, because you&#39;re calling on a non-static method <code>detect</code> from the static context in <code>main</code>. I would recommend reading up on what <code>static</code> means in java.
The operating system won&#39;t change anything. Java is cross-platform by design. The issue here is that <code>â€œâ€�</code> is not the same as <code>&quot;&quot;</code> (notice the curly-ness of your quotes)
Sorry guys, yes, it&#39;s supposed to be -0.0016. Just edited the question. Thanks for pointing that out.
<code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code> <i>is</i> contravariant; not covariant.
Nice &quot;hint&quot; answer per OP request.  UV (Quibble: Disagree with &quot;&quot;strings ... usually terminated with a 0 byte&quot;.  In C, <i>strings always</i> end with a null character, else it is not a string.)
Interesting, I worked a lot on repeated timers, but few on non-repeated timers. So I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s important in this situation. Just curious, if the timer is initialized, then the tableView is removed from superview somehow, then the timer is fired, would that cause any problem? when the tableView is still in memory or not.
What text editor are you using to type it? Whatever it is, I&#39;d suggest using something else.
This worked well - thank you!  I had to hack up my millisecond value a bit as mine were 6 digits long and the datetime datatype expects three digits.  Thank you!!
@Jonathan.Brink no, this is perfect. Just what I was looking for. Thank you for breaking in down. I was looking to check if there is text within the div.
Take a look into your http servers error log file. That is where you can actually <i>read</i> what the error is instead of having to <i>guess</i> or ask here.
Yes, because reduce() returns an Optional&lt;Stream&lt;Integer&gt;&gt;, not a Stream&lt;Integer&gt;.
Yes. Just threath them as different models.
It does nothing because you told the function to return if the value passed in is equal to <code>NULL</code>
Actually an <code>NSTimer</code> will keep its target retained (and the run-loop retains the timer), therefore <code>deinit</code> will never be called so long as the timer is active. You will need to call <code>invalidate()</code> manually at the appropriate time in the object&#39;s lifecycle. Although in this case OP&#39;s timer doesn&#39;t repeat â€“ so the target will only be retained until it&#39;s fired.
I gotta a feeling you&#39;re not loading the <code>jQuery</code> library before trying to use it.
jQuery library correctly linked?
Try adding <code>console.log(typeof $)</code> on the line before, and see what it tells you
<i>Add a class to <code>X</code> when <code>Y</code> is clicked</i> is an <b>extremely</b> common question on SO and the answer is pretty much the same for any X and Y.  Your X and Y are <i>div</i> and <i>other div</i> ... here is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/11068446/17300">a question</a> where X and Y are <i>parent div</i> and <i>div</i>.
@Aurimas Since Ruby is extremely strict about what&#39;s <i>false</i> in a logical sense, <code>|| 7</code> is never going to happen so you may as well abandon that idea: The <i>When in Rome</i> principle applies here. If you&#39;re doing a mapping operation, express it as such. In other languages you can take advantage of zero being a <i>false</i> value so the simplest expression of your desire does vary considerably depending on constraints.
Your example is not much of one. What explicitly have you tried and/or researched?
This is a question and answer site, not a free homework completion service. You need to learn to program yourself, not ask internet strangers to program for you.
It sounds like you might be looking for function+bind but it&#39;s hard to say for sure without more detail in your question.
What is your specific question?
If you are encountering an issue with your code, you should describe the issue and <i>ask</i> for help, not <code>correct my code asap</code>
Those are variables I used because I don&#39;t know your branch names, or the location of your remote servers. For me, it could be <code>git push ~&#47;Desktop&#47;foo foo:master -f</code>, for you it could be something else.
The command <code>ls</code> prints a newline. When <code>ls</code> is streaming output to a pipe, it is running in <code>ls -1</code> mode. See the difference when you run <code>ls</code> and <code>ls | more</code> in terminal and you will see the output is different.
What is your question? If your question is &quot;<i>What is the O-Notation of this code</i>&quot; then you are not on the right website
Are you closing your connections when you&#39;re done with them? Sounds like the OS might be running out of network handles. Some code would help diagnose the issue.
<code>string id</code> is the parameter you sent INTO the function, whereas <code>public string[] showSkeds...</code> would RETURN a string array.  What do you need <b>returned</b> is a better question?
An equivalent access would be <code>$data-&gt;{nav}{current}{performance_gross}</code>
The answer is a definite yes. It&#39;s easy to construct such an algorithm. If you want to find one that is already being used for something, that&#39;s a different matter. You should think about what the numbers could mean: <code>n*</code> means you need to do something for every element of the input set, <code>log n</code> means some kind of divide and conquer operation, and squared means that you probably need another divide and conquer for every step of the previous one.
Then why did you copy the array? Just forget the whole loop and do <code>partRef =myArr;</code> and your done. Now <code>myArr.splice(1, 1)</code> will happen in the <i>shared</i> array.
Take baby-steps, by first trying to build in C++03 mode, and fix potential errors and warnings. Then rebuild in C++11 mode, and again fix errors and warnings. Each of these steps are not that big, and C++11 is mostly backward compatible to C++03 which is mostly backward compatible with C++98. The big breaking things comes in the future C++17 which will remove some deprecated functionality.
I&#39;m french but isn&#39;t it &#39;You are dead&#39; ? EDIT : PURE HTML code but you provided pure JAVASCRIPT code ...........
@tdelaney: That was just a guess. Unless the OP shows how he is running with may be screenshots, we wouldn&#39;t be able to help
If the view being shown has a model of a <i>single instance</i> of something, how do you expect to derive a <i>list</i> of something?  You can turn a basket of apples into individual apples, but you can&#39;t turn an individual apple into a basket of apples.  Also, you can&#39;t create a <code>new</code> instance of an <i>interface</i>, only a <i>class</i>.
can you provide html also?
First of all: these are not dictionaries, these are lists of tuples. Secondly what is the expected output? What you&#39;ve shown us is not a data structure, it&#39;s a drawing. Thirdly: what has a database to do with any of that?
<code>Arrays.toString(result)</code> will be the textual representation of the array (with square brackets and comma between elements).  Is this what you want or do you want to concat all content?  For that <code>String.join(&quot; &quot;, result)</code>
Are you running your html off a server or just your local file system. You do not need an IDE for HTML/javascript development a simple text editor should suffice. If you are running it off your file system place the image in the same folder as your html file.
hmmm, lets see. 8 columns in the column list and 9 values in the value list. I wonder what the error could mean.
In this case, the single quotes around <code>current</code> are optional.  It is the same as: <code>$data-&gt;{nav}-&gt;{current}-&gt;{performance_gross}</code>.  So, <code>current</code> is also a key.

Addendum: <code>^...$</code> will also match the beginning&gt;end of one line in multiline mode
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/q/23047198/1782465">Related question</a>.
Those are not dictionaries?
Better yet, tell us the value of <code>current_user</code>, <code>current_user.foes</code> and <code>@user</code>. TIP: Instead of <code>if foo.bar.first</code> do <code>if foo.bar.exists?</code> Instead of instantiating <code>Disagreement</code> in this case, it will return true or false.
Yes, but don&#39;t do that if you want to keep your co-workers from strangling you. Don&#39;t do this normally. If someone is working on their code on top of that history, your new branch won&#39;t be compatible with their code. Read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6204804/6194839">This</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6206542/6194839">This</a>, and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing/" rel="nofollow">This</a>. You don&#39;t want to mess with remote history. Just add a new commit to undo a previous commit&#39;s history.
Thanks for answer. I am not focusing much on optimization as it is just a hobby project, So quick and dirty is fine with me.
Only if object is referring other object, this will happen...
While <code>Integer</code> doesn&#39;t have a method called <code>[]</code>, <code>Integer</code> is an abstract class with two concrete subclasses, <code>Bignum</code> and <code>Fixnum</code>, both of which <i>do</i> have a <code>[]</code> method.
Why would two instances of a class have different member functions?

@SuperSaiyan may well be right but I am puzzled. If you are running IDLE, the shell window doesn&#39;t have a &quot;run module&quot; selection. Please tell us which tool you use and where you do the run.
And I think a general question is fine, but they are usually driven by concrete examples. So far, it appears that the &quot;real answer&quot; to your question is &quot;Don&#39;t emulate this behavior because you don&#39;t need it&quot;. Presumably that&#39;s not your ideal end state. The question form encourages you to do so <i>because it&#39;s useful</i> and would have prevented you from having to deal with most of these comments ^^.
@tdelaney that is not code, that is the information shown when running an interactive session in python. Notice the title says <code>SyntaxError on &quot;5&quot;</code> but there is no <code>&quot;5&quot;</code> in the code block provided.
are you in need of <code>snprintf()</code>?
If you just used <code>group_by</code>, you wouldn&#39;t need the <code>split</code> and <code>lapply</code>.
@CThompson, I&#39;ve corrected the casing of <code>GetValue</code> in your question based on your comment.  There&#39;s a difference between <code>getValue</code> (which doesn&#39;t exist) and <code>GetValue</code>.  Try to be accurate when presenting code.
