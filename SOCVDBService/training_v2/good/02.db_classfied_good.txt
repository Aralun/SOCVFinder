He clearly told us &quot;...all starting with a name...&quot;
Getting Facebook friends from not-Facebook would be a little tricky, no?
I&#39;d rather ask this question and look like an idiot here than implement several mission critical solutions that break in the field. :-)
I&#39;m going to sound incredibly stupid, but is there an idiots guide for this? I&#39;ve tried following the generic formula on multiple occasions with a small C# console app and I don&#39;t get out numbers that make any sort of sense to me at all.
You&#39;ve just made my life so much better. I&#39;ve been smashing my head against this problem, (and those it causes upstream) for 2 weeks now. Truly thank you.
oh sorry, ive just seen that u use, pos = ()
yup.. u got it right now
@herbert - Just got this too a moment ago, never seen it before. I bet it&#39;s a bug. Don&#39;t know why you&#39;re getting down voted and people voting to close.
You made argsetOf() as static. It ain&#39;t gonna work as you wish being static.
i think he needs to know why it didnt work in his :)
@Dani you are a life saver man, I had been beating my head around for a long time.
i cant understand , what u are saying. i m fresher in phonegap.
Superb dude . I up voted u for saving my day :)
Oh my god. I am the biggest idiot on the planet. Spring Boot requires static resources to be in <code>src&#47;main&#47;resources&#47;resources</code> and not in <code>src&#47;main&#47;resources</code>.
THANK YOU! I was banging my head against this for hours
All right, so we have just made a big mess here :)  You just want the count of how many rectangles you just drawed ? Like everyone else say, you have that in <code>results.Count()</code>.
why man? You&#39;re mixing up way too many framework. Chose one and stick with it
he beat me by a few seconds, i was racing to be first!
He has  <code>csrf_token</code> passed in his <code>$.ajax</code>. If you look closely.
THERE IS NO NEED TO CALL <code>notifyDataSetChanged</code> RIGHT AFTER YOU SET THIS ADAPTER TO THE <code>recyclerView</code> !!!!!!!!!!!! ... also where is a code of adding an items?
You are a boss my friend, thank you for your time :)
If you don&#39;t want to do this yourself, then you can tell Bill. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s happy to do it for you (to gain some magical internet points).
Hi @Frank. I got it working. Actually whenever I was opening the cron.sh file, the system was generating copy of the that file with cron copy.sh. And I was running ./cron.sh like an idiot. Thank you!!
We love to help, but sometimes you just have to get down and dirty with the manual / tutiorials / a decent book, etc.
I am an idiot. Cropper ends before addLine() function declaration.
@TonyStark , Even i&#39;m happy to help iron men ;) btw yr welcom
you saved my life! I love you man!
Well I feel like an idiot, I had some conflicting javascript that was interfering with the &#39;next page&#39; button getting loaded properly. This answer is correct and I will update my question with the answer.

I TESETD YOUR CODE AND NO DATA IS COMING THROUGH THIS LINE:- <code>$app_list=file_get_contents(&#39;http:&#47;&#47;localhost&#47;g.php?action=get_details&#39;);</code>

I love <code>condition ? true : false</code> :D
Well this sucks... the backend of the iframe site has a bug that will not allow me to add the &lt;base target=&quot;_parent&quot; /&gt; tag to the head of the site. Unfortunately I do it like this because there are around 300-500 links.
How should you find out if anybody, anywhere in the world does whatever he likes with your software on his own hardware?
HOLY WOW THAT IS AWESOME!!!!! - That is a REALLY cool trick that makes perfect sense!!!
i suppose you mean does the fosuserbundle exists and is it tracked ? the bundle exists in my copy.. But, i use git add .  does it mean that files could be / are untracked ? I suck at git :/

Hey friend can u tell me what graph is this
They are more popular, because most people have non-graph punch in their punch bowls.
I feel real stupid. That&#39;s what happens when you work too many hours in a day. Thanks!
They can give all the explanations they want. I still feel like someone made the wrong call when introducing <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>ITask</code> but no <code>ITask&lt;out T&gt;</code>.
i love you .....
As always u have been awesome!
u mean i have to mute music on call_state_ringing?.
But they act as libraries in ProjectA anyway and should not influence the configuration of its DI container. If it happens by coincedence, say, if ProjectA has no its own context.xml configuration and spring is picking up one from classpath (by default)
May be Knuth&#39;s writings is a best place to start? He discuss many of these aspects...
By default, all components of the same application run in the same process.If you kill your app the process is terminated by android, you should start a service as a separate process  if you want to run some background work even if you kill your app.
OK X) i feel a little stupid .....
i am making a game like tic tac toe
Yes and it&#39;s not a problem, or I do not remember  a case where this leads to a problem. AFAIK you have the option in plone to switch between email as login and login name as login. If you do so, changing the login should also work in your case.
It&#39;s just one of the utterly unbelievable things about Apple that they haven&#39;t fixed this.  That, and the fucked-up graphics cards in MBPs.

I hate to bother you once more, but there&#39;s no one else in this thread... Would you please check it again, sir. Now all I want to know is if it works. And if it does it probably the Computational Geometry equivalent of BubbleSort&#39;s retarded cousin.
i just cant get it to work im literally making biger mess every time
People like you make the world a better place
I gonna have a look!
Cody Gray, I don&#39;t know who he is. I have just joined in.
@AndreyChernukha Thanks...I&#39;m gonna get some sleep and take another crack at it when I&#39;m up. If I still haven&#39;t gotten it you can take a look. Much obliged.
Ok honestly, this answer is so perfect, ThanIt&#39;s working! You really saved my ass! Thank you so much sir! Just last question for the camera its the same? Like just swap imageURI_vybrana for  imageView_Fotak? And again thank you!!

@h0tw1r3 THX man
Apparently your game just cares about rank, not suits?
With all due respect, you shot yourself in the foot with a Regexp.
wow...I feel incredibly dumb right now. Like I said...probably something dumb. Thanks a ton.

Nope. I gave him the key word he needs. BitmapData.hitTest
@halois people get trigger happy with downvoting
HOW TO COUNT THE EACH WORD&#39;S FREQUENCY IN EACH ROW?
YES.  <code>{   &quot;data&quot;: [   ],   &quot;summary&quot;: {     &quot;total_count&quot;: 1   } }</code>  But.And where these friends ?. Photo and name?
@chrisaycock - yeah, I&#39;ve noticed :/   I would think that this would be possible though.
At CR you frequently find yourself wanting to give people +10.
This man is a genius.
THEN WHY DOESN&#39;T IT SAY SO :-(
THanks. I&#39;ll go hang my head in shame..
Ah, this sucks! I think compiler writers would like to go the extra mile to annoy users, it is perfectly valid to have a type that includes a map that has its type as value. Quite useful too.
@julesbou Ok, no problem
@chrisaycock agreed thx.  as a matter of style I chose <code>T</code> for brevity.
Ha ha... very funny...

With <code>sudo: false</code> the build is always in a docker cuntainer
oh I feel dumb...
call proc.terminate() or proc.kill() in the call back
^what he said, buy you&#39;re missing a colon after <code>elif</code>
well that was a life saver...
Can you ask the person who sent them to you?
DO NOT PERFORM GUI ACTIONS OFF THE EVENT DISPATCH THREAD (EDT)!
THANK YOU, you&#39;re a life saver!
Good job ! I voted up (y)

How dare you? Do you think it&#39;s funny to make my life a living heaven? Do you?

Finally i have found my mistake. In the C#-code i swapped in the heat of the night two parameters :) If wanna hear the right song to the moment, listen to Glen Campbell &quot;Guess i&#39;m dumb&quot;.
@drescherjm wow, its great then let me do few more research and come up to u for more doubts .. once again thanks
oh yea.. sorry .. let me do it now
Indeed, it&#39;s a transitive dependency, look at its <a href="https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/webjars/bower/angular-chart.js/0.10.2/angular-chart.js-0.10.2.pom" rel="nofollow">pom</a>
AFAIK you need to pass either ViewBag or ViewData contains maximum amount of array index to apply on view input, iterate through 1 or 2 loops while providing either multiquestions[i][j] or questions[i] to print text input with indexed name attribute.
Understood, now. thx all. I will go back and re-learn.
You saved my day too! I was going crazy
I almost cried... so happy... so happy... I want to give you a million up votes.
oh wow I could have thought of that one myself.
Good Job...keep it up..u really saved my day and life....cant explain my feelings...thank you bro.
Every day&#39;s a school day. A nice regex feature I have never actually seen before.

Alexis, here is head of 1 store:
Thank you for your answer. Let&#39;s assume that I&#39;m a complete idiot (as I&#39;ve been known to be one from time to time haha), can you think of anything that I could have possibly screwed up to cause this? Worst-case scenario kind of thing?

Excuse me, i know i looked like complete idiot but i&#39;m not sure that i understand what you mean
I kind of understand it now, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m using it right.  I serialized a variable with the value of 5, and then after deserializing on startup of the program, and printing out the value, it was still 0.
you are right friend , excuse me !
oh.. right.. Let me get back to you..
I love you @MarcGravell
You&#39;ve made me entire day! Thankyou.
lack of research effort
Agree but -1 for answering a dupe.  You should know better.
This shows zero effort on the author's part.
Seriously did not even try did you. Please at least search Google if not stack overflow before posting a question.
If programming is your thing then a little bad information won&#39;t hurt anyway. Everyone knows what they&#39;re talking about, but many of them are very, very wrong, even when you get into the workplace. Half the challenge is figuring out who to listen to. If your instructor is giving you questionable information and you&#39;ve figured out where he/she is off then you&#39;re on the right track.
@Luffy I think the downvote is because it is genuinely very unclear; but I can even things up a bit...
Voting to close as unclear, as a question was asked in the comments, but no clarifications were forthcoming.
By no means I want this question to be closed, but isn&#39;t this question a bad fit by SO standards? Similar questions have been closed because their title&#39;s was categorized as opinion based. I just don&#39;t get it that SO works. Perhaps how SO rulings works is opinion based. (:(
<code>gdb</code> from a console, or a multitude of windowing wrappers that drive commands to gdb if you&#39;re into guis. Personally, I&#39;d hit the web for a quick-info tutorial on gdb and old-school it from a console as a learning experience. Trust me, the effort it will pay for itself many time over. Don&#39;t forget to build with debug-symbols enabled (-g)
@Veverke. XML is very strict about the format of attributes. HTML&#39;s rules are much looser. e.g. <code>id=&#39;foo&#39;</code> is a valid HTML attr but invalid in XML. Really, they&#39;re both derivatives of SGML.
Thank you, stupid mistake -_-
Please search first as this only gets asked thousands of times on this site. <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=site:stackoverflow.com+printing+arrays+in+java" rel="nofollow">For example</a>
If you can&#39;t properly formulate what exactly you&#39;re trying to do, finding or getting help are not going to be easy. Anyway this is not about programming, so off-topic for Stack Overflow.
I&#39;m afraid this type of question isn&#39;t a good fit for Stack Overflow. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic">stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic</a>
if you guys ant say anything just don&#39;t down-vote simply without asking

Please don&#39;t downvote my questions without explaining the reason! It limits my privileges. I&#39;m just new here, guys, come on!

To clarify the comment by @AlonEitan - the recommended <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> asks the device to render the website based off its actual pixel width, rather than the pixel density which can sometimes cause a website to load as though you were zoomed out.
You&#39;re leaving a trail of unanswerable and unanswered questions. Watch out: beyond a certain number of such questions, you&#39;ll find yourself unable to ask new questions. Best to delete such threads before forum rules catch up with you.
Perhaps you should expand your acronyms, for people who don&#39;t know what SPOJ or WA mean.

I noticed you&#39;re just doing a bulk edit and strip off the <code>FATAL =&gt;</code> from your <code>use warnings;</code> lines. May I ask? Are you just cleaning up? I read about it and learned FATAL is not particularly recommended nowadays. Is that the reason? No offense, I&#39;m just curious. (this is a self-destructing comment.)
This is a great question! Generally people want the opposite of what you&#39;re asking for!
I don&#39;t mind the downvote but I would appreciate an explanation that would allow to make the answer better.
You&#39;re welcome and don&#39;t forget to mark you questions as answered (if they are) so others can benefit from them.
Don&#39;t forget to upvote answer(s) and choose the best answer <code>\ud83d\ude03</code>
You&#39;re getting downvoted because before asking you should try something and then come here and ask what is not working. Providing code is a vital part of a question
You are always allowed to answer your own question. Normally it is only done when the solution isn&#39;t covered by an existing answer and when you think that your own answer will be helpful for others.

That&#39;s not how SO works. We are not a debug/fix/write my code for me site. You do the work, we help - <i>if</i> you ask well researched and well explained <i>specific</i> questions.
I went through your other questions on StackOverflow, and there&#39;s not a single well-researched, well-asked, precise question amongst these. Please go and read the &quot;how to ask a question&quot; page, and also inform yourself on which topics are allowed on StackOverflow. This question is totally off-topic.
And reading a SPARQL tutorial does not work for you?
How do you expect us to know whats going on without seeing any code or the website itself?
Showing the action isn&#39;t going to help us identify why it&#39;s getting called twice. That&#39;s like showing us a bullet and asking us to identify the shooter!

@user1937198:  You don&#39;t need the cast to <code>const void *</code> - an address will implicitly convert anyway.
@dorukayhan Not anymore. The community shouldn&#39;t need to downvote answers to clean up.
if you meant the single quotes, i have corrected it. Also this might not be a copy-paste soln. beacuse i dont know ur db schema.  You can understand the logic and implement.
hold it dude - are you including your OWN &quot;manual&quot; trees ?!!  like real physical trees?

why is everyone down voting this?
why would you guys downvote this good question
I&#39;m voting to close this question as off-topic because asking for code is not the purpose of this site. Please read the FAQ.
Have you actually tried debugging your own code before posting? Does this even compile? Last time I checked <code>or</code> isn&#39;t a valid keyword
Wrong site. You&#39;re looking for <a href="http://askubuntu.com">Ask Ubuntu</a> or <a href="http://superuser.com">Super User</a> instead. This site is for programming questions.
Don&#39;t know why you got a downvote (just like i got one for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38161811/dplyr-how-to-avoid-hard-coding-variable-names-when-i-need-them-all/38162559#38162559">this</a>).  Plus one.
I&#39;m afraid this is off-topic here. You can look this up in any math textbook.
Give answer if you know how to solve this instead downvote the question.
I also have another question a bit off-topic. How do you guys get notified that a question is posted on Stack Overflow. I got your reply very fast.
Those errors aren&#39;t caused by my answer, they&#39;re a consequence of the compiler going further down its checklist now that I fixed the most pressing error.
@Divakar It&#39;s on my feed :) I haven&#39;t been answering questions lately though... lots of stuff going on on my end.
@Patrick -  I don&#39;t have one and I don&#39;t have the time to create one.  If you wan&#39;t to fork your plunker, or create a new one,  and give it a try I will do what I can to help you.
Yes sorry I managed to solve it, it was the most stupid error I&#39;ve ever done. I put an underscore instead of the dash when naming the file!
This is fucking awesome. Thanks so much. I understand most of the code, I just have a few questions. Is there a reason why the print method is at the bottom? and how come it replaces the output of the first block? Wouldn&#39;t the code run the main method first and fail?
 it doesnt matter where the print function is declared  &#39;how come it replaces the output of the first block&#39; wtf? can you write it again * you need to return a variable thats why system.out.println() did not work
This isn&#39;t hard to understand.  The dropdown is in a container that clips all its content and hides it, but the menu has a high z-index to put it above everything, but that doesn&#39;t help because the container still clips it.  In other words, the menu shouldn&#39;t be in the container at all.  Bootstrap&#39;s menu sucks, because it doesn&#39;t parent the menu to the document above everything, it just leaves it in whatever container it happens to be in.  It&#39;s bad design.
Both of these solutions work, however when I ctrl c to kill the testtail command my prompt turns red. Any Idea what thats all about?
1)check the configuration  options--configure texmaker--command--biblatex: bibtex %.aux  2)use the stupid pdflatex-biblatex-pdflatex pdflatex order to compile  3) try to match the bibtex version with the biber version I have now 2.5 and 3.5 so hope something is working i dont know  ....i ve been like 3 days searching for a solution
Do you know at which place should I applied the code? I replaced the &quot;app&quot; by the actual app id, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work. I think it might be safer to go with option 2 since it will open a new window, there is less chance of something going wrong for the people clicking. And thanks for your first answer! :) Also i should ass that this is dedicated to mobile only, not that it would change a lot of things.
I&#39;m not sure, but version: true might be interpreted like --version, thus typedoc simply emits the version and quits.
If is just a part of your messages, you can use internazionalization but adding parameters so you can make it a little bit more dynamic.
not a shitty calc, just don&#39;t give up :) !
It was a joke about another post Fred. The one where the guy said you were doing it wrong.
Your comment however didn&#39;t help me with my question...
Haha. Don&#39;t worry about it!
got it...i was stupid that when I add ` url: &quot;{{ url(&#39;/getVariants&#39;) }}&quot;+&#39;/&#39;+ master_id,` it showed me 500 internal error and I thought i must be some other error...when I print some value thn it shows me the response....
i was so stupid....it was an server error later...
Exactly what I was looking for. The reasoning why the last day is left out. Still, its a stupid default.
Okay think you can ignore my stupidness - I&#39;ve found another duplicated StackOverflow post here <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28999400/swift-uitableview-custom-cell-programatically-documentation" title="swift uitableview custom cell programatically documentation">stackoverflow.com/questions/28999400/&hellip;</a> - will just follow this :)
Oh thank you very much, i was looking at that stupid gradle example and thinking that keep is something like &quot;dont modify this source cos i might debug it&quot; or similar stuff :)
Everybody please help me!
Not at all. But this doesn&#39;t jump to the definition of a struct either, when ctrl+clicking on a struct name
Oh no... My Playground shows me how many times my &quot;if&quot; statement is true... I put a print(&quot;&quot;) inside my loop and shows me 8 times... I understand now... Sorry for this stupid question :/
Interfaces are good. But for looser coupling, use broadcast listeners.
Sorry for giving away the trade secrets, boys.
Can I move question? Or should I repost it?
I wanna be like you when I grow up ;)
How are we supposed to know?
I really can&#39;t understand the question
@DavidSchwartz: Further, unless looser semantics have been requested, a compiler should ensure that all register-cached values whose address has been exposed to the outside world are synchronized with their underlying storage before and after any <code>vo
Besides being a dangling pointer, adding insult to injury this code will attempt to retrieve, randomly, element 1 through 6 from an array that contains elements 0 through 5. 1/6th of a time, this will result in undefined behavior, and a likely crash.
@ThomasF thanks, I didn&#39;t know that, I only bothered to remember that <code>window.isNaN</code> is a piece of garbage. <code>Number.isNaN</code> is much more usable.
@PavelMinaev back one year later. I have now accepted it :) Eagle couldn&#39;t be more right in his poetry.
@YourCommonSense Ok. But How can somebody down vote without knowing the concept :(
Please read my question carefully. I asked &quot;auto trim&quot;, not &quot;manual trim&quot;
Old answer, but still very relevant. Code Analysis (as it is now) still has some silly rules (such as this one) which assume coders are idiots. Anyone who even half way understands the language knows what <code>readonly</code> means. First thing I do when setting up a new project is disable a ton of CA rules such as CA2104.
good to know you manage to resolve
this community is all about <b>programming</b>, not commandline help
How silly I am for this stupid question......shame on me.
To actually add insult to injury: why in the world somebody thought of adding <code>QList&lt;T&gt; QVector&lt;T&gt;::toList()</code>, instead of a ranged constructor?
Gotta love those people who simply downvote questions without reading them.
Well if you know what you&#39;re doing, yeah...
@ThomasKl&#228;ger nevermind, I was able to finally narrow down the problem. The way I have it, is that one of  the ways you can open the <code>JDialog</code> is through a submenu when you right click. However, I kept reading the <code>JMenuItem</code>s w
I couldn&#39;t so am asking...
but .......... i dont knw
@Mike u r right. Thanks for saving my ass :)
God damn I feel like an idiot now lol; <code>if(count &lt;= -1) {</code>
Holy jesus. I probably just made the biggest blunder of my life. You&#39;re right!
Why was this voted down? Vote downs with no explanation are the worst thing about SO.
Managed to solve it. Ugh, what an idiot. The <code>UIScrollView</code> was sitting inside a <code>UIView</code> which was sitting inside a <code>UIContainerView</code>. I was moving the <code>UIView</code> up on <code>KeyboardWillShow</code>; and this was, whilst visually OK, pushing the <code>UIView</code> outside of its parents boundaries, so touches weren&#39;t registering. Thanks for your help @matt  :)
Wow thank you I feel like an idiot. Thanks for taking the time!
no. he told a joke! @Damon
I see ! You&#39;re good then.
I don&#39;t why he&#39;s getting minus he asked a decent question.
btw a great tool for this is Relacy, it allows simulating looser memory models on x86, I wrote up my adventure here <a href="http://www.codersblock.org/blog/2016/6/02/ditching-the-mutex" rel="nofollow">codersblock.org/blog/2016/6/02/ditching-the-mutex</a>
Do you guys have any idea about this
If you cannot your self tell from your stack trace what causes the error, you may want to post the stack trace here.
Don&#39;t ever let anyone tell you that you are not the man because you are THE MAN!
We are all learning lol; don&#39;t feel bad at all
You&#39;re the mvp!
This question with his answer are really useful for those who are not a designer and can&#39;t effort / don&#39;t want to pay one.
hi @domi, lol you&#39;re hilarious
I&#39;ll do that. Sorry for wasting people&#39;s time.
I only wanted to mention it, not to insult you. It does not mater how long you in, but how many different type of tasks you have done. Everyone is learning.
He is <code>ser.write(chr(int(parameters[counter])).encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;) + chr(int(parameters[counter+1])).encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;))</code> twist, so rape serial port, which incoming first(<b>FIFO</b>), where a query where matched answer? Who clear <code>serial buffer</code>? He send query and try opening file, what is timeout exception ?
