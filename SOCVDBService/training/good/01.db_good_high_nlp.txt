I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it's not a programming question.
I had all these crazy ideas about prefetch_related and select_related. Thought it was so hard.

I used what u said simply just <code>this.getView.setModel(oJSonModel);</code> wasn&#39;t that what you advised me?
Why the down vote? I always enjoy Joe Blow&#39;s colorful answers with Unity life lesson. I have certainly learnt a lot from him.

As @cricket_007 suggested, word detection can be extremely difficult (often requiring machine learning, and AI algorithms) and introduce a whole wealth of natural language ambiguities, your data source should be fixed.

Ok Daniel, how I don&#39;t know where are you, but if you want i can buy you a ticket to get here and give me some punches on my empty head... i think it was all about LEADING SLASH... :( :(
oh yeh that was pretty stupid of me... been a long day but thanks
Well, you don&#39;t have to use a mocking framework. You can always create mock classes yourself! And honestly: if your hands are really handcuffed like this; and you are not allowed to do the things that make sense; you better turn back to your manager ...
Then you can&#39;t read from it.  As a workaround, and depending on how much work you want to put in, and how hacky you want the solution to be, you could look in to writing a test application using TestStack from White (<a href="http://www.teststack.net...
Let&#39;s hope you&#39;re right ??
Hopefully helped OP, got 4 rep, today was a good day ;)
@jbrown looks like he did, but I don&#39;t think thats the cause of his error....? is it?

Im sorry im unclear abt ur question what ur asking with me
When you say &quot;Parameter name&quot; are you talking about <code>Parameter.Designation</code>?
@JoshLeeDucks When pushing they don&#39;t change to <code>public</code> automagically anymore (at least for me they don&#39;t).
:bryan so how can i do full back up as you said?
Stupid me and genius you ))
