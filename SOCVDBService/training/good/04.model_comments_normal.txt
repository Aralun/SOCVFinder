@DonaldC. because gsub takes two parameters if you want it to return a string -  I&#39;m guessing you want  <code>random_doc.gsub(&#39; doc&#39;,&#39;&#39;)</code>
@Eugene it is not always question of tradeoff. There must be some way which improves both
More importantly, appending strings exposes your code to sql injection, what if the value of <code>_db_name</code> was <code>&quot;table; delete from table;&quot;</code> It&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t use parameters for the tablename, but we must at least sanitize the value or verify that such a table exists first.
Could you update your post to include the contents of the &#39;table&#39; object?
You probably mean <code>UIPageViewController</code>.
The best way is storing the session in DB. For more accuracy, you can monitor the IP as well. So, if user cleared the cookie, you still don&#39;t allow him/her to perform the action
the selected parameter in option  specifies that an option should be pre-selected when the page loads.
In first comment i wrote result from <code>CMTimeGetSeconds</code>. Sorry if it was not clear. Also <code>CMTimeMakeWithSeconds(10.0, NSEC_PER_SEC)</code> that I&#39;ve tried was the finest grain - it took 10 nanoseconds instead of 0.01 of a second which I use in my original post.
How would you apply an inline style to a react component <i>without</i> the ternary operator?
@RobertHarvey Thanks. But not being a <b>C</b> programmer, I wonder if there are limits to that. Corrupting other processes? The OS?
oops yes, typo. Ill fix it sorry
its internally generated I think
What do you mean and replace with needed? You mean per var?
Thanks, it worked! ;)
It is even easier. min and max are from the same dataset. Y is always an IP-Address. Each Ip-Address is guaranteed to have two x values at the same position. So the Pseudocode would be: <code>for i &lt;= length(data$min) do drawLine(\[min,i\], \[max, i\]</code>
Not clear to me what you are asking.  Composer coexists nicely with bower or npm.  You just need a process to copy the files from the bower directory to your web directory.  I use a simple gulp file but there are plenty of other ways.  Though I suspect you are asking for something completely different.
No, I made new Acceleo project by wizard and change only registerPackages method. I don&#39;t have a custom factory.
<code>explain analyze delete from my_table ...</code> will show the list of autogenerated triggers called for the cascade deletions. Note that <code>explain analyze ...</code> performs the operation so if you don&#39;t want to delete the data then wrap it into the <code>begin; ... rollback;</code> block.
indeed, that&#39;s the cause
There are no console errors.
I don&#39;t think sharing the parameter pack from <code>thrust::tuple&lt;Args...&gt;</code> with <code>(*fp)(Args...)</code> is going to work.  In the case of the <code>Args...</code> associated with your function, it is just <code>int</code>, but in the case of a thrust tuple with a single int, the <code>Args...</code> are actually <code>int, thrust::null_type, thrust::null_type, thrust::null_type, thrust::null_type, thrust::null_type, thrust::null_type, thrust::null_type, thrust::null_type, thrust::null_type</code>, so we get the following note after your substitution failed message: <code>note:  inconsistent parameter pack deduction...</code>
how do you specify the max zoom ?
Well, one way would be to use range to simulate the colon operation and then just index into cols : <code>A[:,np.hstack((2,4,range(6,10+1),range(50,80+1)))]</code>.
Tried that, model is still coming out the same:  <code>{   &quot;id&quot;: 0,   &quot;type&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,   &quot;name&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,   &quot;user&quot;: {     &quot;id&quot;: 0,     &quot;username&quot;: &quot;string&quot;   },   &quot;widgets&quot;: [     {       &quot;id&quot;: 0,       &quot;layout&quot;: {         &quot;id&quot;: 0,         &quot;col&quot;: 0,         &quot;row&quot;: 0,         &quot;sizex&quot;: 0,         &quot;sizey&quot;: 0       },       &quot;dashwidgets&quot;: {},       &quot;widgetType&quot;: &quot;string&quot;,       &quot;resizable&quot;: false,       &quot;canpopout&quot;: false,       &quot;settings&quot;: &quot;string&quot;     }   ] }</code>

@prashkr I am able to initialize a numpy zeros matrix. So I do not think that it is related to max numpy array size. The program is consuming a lot of memory while executing loop.

That is actually a different problem. Now that the language is properly being passed to the page, you will need to check the query string and select the option as selected. This can be done server side or client side.
you&#39;re calling <code>setInterval</code>, you need to clear twice too.
@ybungalobill : I agree with all of that. But, value-initialization is always strictly better than <code>memset(0)</code>, period.

Your requirement seems rather straightforward. Checkout <a href="http://kwatee.net" rel="nofollow">kwatee</a> (disclaimer: I am the creator). It may do exactly what you need with a minimal learning curve.
In the first listing, you need &quot;listBox1.SelectedItem = listBox1.Items[i]&quot;, instead of &quot;listBox1.SelectedItem = item&quot;.
I am no category theory expert but AFAIK the name <code>void</code> and <code>unit</code> comes from category theory. <code>void</code> is a category with no members,  <code>unit</code> is a category with one member, <code>bool</code> is a category with two members (true &amp; false). <code>void</code> is inherited from C and it&#39;s a major hassle for generic code. Typically in Java, C# and C++ you need to handle the <code>void</code> case specifically because it&#39;s an odd type (it has no value). <code>unit</code> is subtly superior as it has one value meaning there&#39;s no need to for special cases.
That statement is a bit misleading as it comes from Microsoft. ES6 has nothing to do with Typescript.  Typescript has similarities to ES6 in that it also has a pre-standards module system (like how Angular 1 has a pre-standards module system).  Now that there is a formal standard, clinging to pre-standards TS modules is foolhardy.
See the code I posted.  This is a much more efficient way to copy a value from one spreadsheet to a range in a newly opened file.  Not sure what the filtering was doing for you, but you couldn&#39;t paste a copied range into single cells in a loop anyway.  I assume your <code>CountA</code> formulas were just trying to get the number of cells as well.
Yeah, I had a hard time finding it at first to. It&#39;s not obvious. Heck, honestly, I had a hard time find the Google Developer Console in the first place. I bookmarked it explicitly because I didn&#39;t want to have to track it down again ;).

MoustafaS, because you asked me I have tried it, but it did not yield the result you expected. The cause of this is that Page_Init is executing the assignment too late and Page_Load is executed even later.
First of all provide html with elements. I guess you can use xpath like this: <code>.&#47;&#47;*[contains(@class,&#39;btn-cart&#39;)]</code>. Remember that class is changing, probably button is not always <code>active</code>. The second thing - don&#39;t use autogenerated  xpaths  like <code>&#47;&#47;div&#47;div[2]&#47;div[666]&#47;span[99]&#47;div[69]</code>, they won&#39;t work in week and even you will not know how they should work

Thank you for answer. But one question,(please take into account that I am new in Ignite) I understood from your answer that TcpDiscoverySpi used for building cluster,and TcpCommunicationSpi for operations with caches?...If it is so,how I managed using only DiscoverySpi I build cluster with 2 remote nodes on server and one client mode(local node) and I successfully did puts/gets between nodes(when my caches are replicated or partitioned).  And I didnt use CommunicatuonSpi. I think that DiscoverySpi normally understood.but ComunicationSpi is unsertine for me.

The first sample script that i posted did encode three hundred .srt files in folders and subfolders in the specific path which contained folders with diffrent names. it encoded them perfectly but it didnt encode files in folders with unicode characters in their names like the example above, so somehow i needed the script to recognize these folders in general not just one folder or a specific folder.

Apostrophe&#39;s and single quotes use the same symbol but have different meanings. Suppose your string were <code>&quot;She said, &#39;I don&#39;t know&#39;&quot;</code>. Do you want to obtain <code>&quot;She said, &#39;I dont know&#39;&quot;</code> (removing apostrophe&#39;s only) or <code>&quot;She said, I dont know&quot;</code> (removing the symbol <code>&quot;&#39;&quot;</code>) or something else? If it&#39;s the former, it&#39;s a bit tricky because some words have an apostrophe after the last character (&quot;bro&#39;&quot;, or the possessive form for words ending with an &quot;s&quot;, such as &quot;Chris&#39; car&quot;) and some words have multiple apostrophe&#39;s (&quot;couldn&#39;t&#39;ve&quot;).

This is a multi-statement table valued function. They work but the performance is abysmal. Most of the time a scalar function will outperform this type of table valued function.
One more question - a call to the function contains two parameters (column names) -<code>getPacklistItemLotSerial(shiphead_id, coitem_id)</code>. Since any of column names in the query don&#39;t have column prefixes, it is hard to guess which one comes from which table. Could you explan which column does come from which table ? I suppose that <code>coitem_id</code> comes from <code>coitem</code> table, buf can&#39;t guess what table does <code>shiphead_id</code> column come from ?

Some idea of the algorithm would be helpful. Starting at D2, the next cell with the same value is in F3, which is one row (and two columns) away. You&#39;ve said it is two rows. The next cell is B5, two rows and four columns away from F3, and 3 rows and 2 columns from D2. You can see how this might confuse anyone trying to help.

Then comes the question of <i>why</i> PHP needs to know or care about the encoding.
You seem to have two &quot;filters&quot; in your query, maybe remove the outer one since it doesn&#39;t seem to serve any purpose and its probably screwing up the query? Also why do you specify size as 0 everywhere? it&#39;ll just give you back 0 results if I&#39;m not wrong.
Your JSfilddle is not for my answer, it is for @Spencer Wieczorek

This is a know limitation.  Currently report embeds are limited to a single filter expression.  Support for multiple filters and other client side commands are coming soon.

I know, but for a MCVE that only reproduces your issue, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue to use iTextSharp AGPL and get an answer to your question 3 comments above? I&#39;m not saying that you should plug 5.5.9 into your full product codebase, just extract a small piece of it that reproduces your problem and try there with 5.5.9. In fact, by posting your code in your question, you have already made that small part open source.

@MagnusHoff: Exactly. I understand that this can happen. But I wonder how to deal with it when having such constructs hidden in a lot of code because it makes the code very hard to maintain.
Some sample data and desired results would be great

Why are you using arrays instead of <code>std::string</code> to store strings? And <code>gets</code>? Why.
@ EvilTeach I considered mentioning the &quot;double-quote&quot; option, but I found that adds complexity to Java in that when you request the data from that column, you must be exact, i.e. it is NOT case-indifferent.

Your comment here looks like the solution! Iremoved my longprocess delegate and started that in a background worker instead. I implemented the cancellation and completed booleans like you wrote on the other post. Great idea. I kept the displayResult method the same. Looks correct to me.

There could be so many things happening in your code. We cannot understand unless you explain the right flow of your code.
You probably want <code>OK=$(wget ...; echo $?)</code>; your current code will <i>always</i> echo 1, without waiting for <code>wget</code> to complete. Better yet, don&#39;t use <code>OK</code> at all and use <code>if wget -nd -p http:&#47;&#47;...&#47;$BUILD; then</code>.
Try setting the color into the load, there all properties would have been loaded correctly.
@NathanOliver - Sorry for the late reply. That only works if the lambda has no closure (i.e., no captures), since a unique closure needs to be created for each dynamic instance of the lambda.

As soon as the PayPal view appears it has &quot;Mock Data&quot; at the bottom.  I&#39;m definitely using the production API code.  So, it looks like it&#39;s immediately going into sandbox mode.
@YMM first, you should edit them in as text. If they really had to be screenshots (they don&#39;t) you could embed them. Second, you can see from the output that <code>SValues</code> is an array, so PetSerAl&#39;s second suggestion is likely the solution.
I found out what I was doing wrong. Apparently, you need to load the webpages directly through localhost and not through PHPStorm. Its working perfectly now. Thank you all for your answers and sorry for making a problem out of something that did not exist in the first place.  So, how do I close this thread?
The best way to do that on any kind of OS is to try and then get stuck on a specific problem. Then post parts of problematic code and get help. People here are keen to help out that way, but they don&#39;t provide code for free.
I&#39;m also skeptical about your <code>setLocation()</code> method. I personally would use a <code>GridLayout</code>.
It got to be that. Perhaps try <code>dd($erros);</code> at the beginning of your view file and see if you get the errors.
Yes! I got this error in workbench itself.

<code>SET NAMES</code> and <code>set_charset</code> tell the server what encoding the bytes are in.  &quot;Binding&quot; does not know or care how the strings are encoded.  So it is <i>not</i> sufficient.
Hi Scott. I ended up going with the BindingList&lt;T&gt; option suggested by LarsTech.  That seems to be the most straight forward for what I am trying to accomplish.  Thanks for your input and suggestions.
I won&#39;t give an answer for that. I cannot reproduce this. You&#39;ll have to look at the interpreter lifecycle I guess but this stuff is not really documented and changed significantly in time. It will also differ between configurations and modes.

He is talking about maintaining a pool of already created objects and only creating a new instance if the pool is empty, kind of like how connection pooling works only generic instead of just connections. I agree though, for light objects it is a bit of a waste.

@Doberon What do you mean?
Ok, just because there&#39;s multiple 24&#39;s there...is it the first 24, where it is      24: { ... }?, or do you need to find the id:&quot;24&quot; at the pe level to determine which array?
I thought the question wasn&#39;t useful, so I reposted it with a bit more information. I&#39;m still not sure how to proceed given the feedback, since the instructions and the feedback do not align. The instructions say to place the gradle.properties file in the project root, which I&#39;m assuming is where the three folders are. I have done so and it only has three lines which are the locations of the sdk, ndk, and version. I still don&#39;t know how to proceed with &quot;gradle build&quot;, and the gradle documentation is long and complicated, not even sure where to start for my current situation.

@itsme86 Thanks. I assume, though, that there are <i>some</i> known limits. For example - my code can&#39;t access memory that&#39;s reserved for other processes on the computer, so it can&#39;t crash other programs or the operating system. Right?

@AlexMeyer I can use $program_seg-&gt;attendees-&gt;wherePivot(&#39;registered&#39;,1)-&gt;count() directly in my view...if that&#39;s what you mean? If you mean can I put that into the controller where it gets eager loaded, that is what I can&#39;t figure out.
Are you basically talking about a factory? It&#39;s a common OO pattern. The pooling could be a component of it, but, in general, instantiating an object is extremely quick and pooling would be unnecessary unless there&#39;s a lot of object setup to be done in the constructor. The only way to make it generic really would be to use reflection to instantiate the objects.
the complex case does not work.. jsfiddle.net/8k0v9eyL/4 only the li with treeview class which has element under it which has the reqd url should become active .. not all

Could you edit your post and provide more detailed example of your code? In the excerpt you&#39;ve pasted I see that you&#39;re using <code>repartition</code> method, but you&#39;re not assigning the result to any variable. Since DStreams are immutable, that statement is useless (it effectively makes a new repartitioned instance, but it&#39;s never used). Of course your full code might be already using it somehow, that&#39;s why it would be nice to see more comprehensive example. By the way you didn&#39;t have to remove your previous screenshots, all of them are useful in situations like that ;)

@LeoDeBruyn ah, that&#39;s because <code>&lt;</code> doesn&#39;t compare <code>null</code> values. I edited my answer to use a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> with an <code>OR</code> condition in the <code>HAVING</code> clause. Hope you figure it out.
Ok, i&#39;ve tried both - same result
@DarkTemplar I guess you need to use <code>unset xtics</code> to remove the &quot;needles&quot;
Like i see the problem is other, just putting <code>$im2 = new Imagick($pdfFile); </code> the script show me the error <code>Uncaught exception &#39;ImagickException&#39; with message &#39;no decode delegate for this image format </code>PNG&#39; @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/504&#39;`

This is inefficient and should be done at the SQL level.
We have an error and some code, which is a good start. Any chance you might write some introductory text about the help you would like to receive? What have you tried? What are you trying to do, given that you know this code is insecure?

That ends in <code>unlist</code> so I guess you&#39;re depending on the data being sorted by the splitting vars? Maybe <code>unsplit</code> is a more general option.
ok i will do that soon

Negative. I did (read: we did) FP in C++ in an inv. bank and it works flawless. It&#39;s also way faster and needs much less support: easier to write test for and easier to argue when sg goes wrong. Self documenting and fun and you&#39;ll understand you don&#39;t need sw caches :).

Wow! That worked, but I had to make some improvements to support rect&#39;s origin changing. I still don&#39;t know why that is happening. Maybe someday we will know something about this mystery.
@Alex I am wondering why you removed accepted tick?
I would use a collection of objects where every object has one property for each column data. Basically a ORM does this way: when you get a row create a new object or you create an object and then saves to database. One row mapped to an object and edited in your form where you can show or hide any property as you wish.
@orde Ok :) sorry
Sounds good. I will add it as an answer. Let me know if you have any questions once you try it out.
Did you ever figure out why this was happening?
@RobertNavado yes, it can take any Reader (in stdin) in the contructor

You are not using the ng-model, the question is similar in the fact that you are both trying to access a outer controller from an inner controller.

True, XAMPP 3.2.2 (with php 5.6.21) comes with bad version of OCI8. I&#39;ve followed your link and now it&#39;s working! Thank you.  I&#39;ve download php_oci8-2.0.8-5.6-ts-vc11-x86.zip
The <code>unique_constraint</code> works alright and the corresponding unit test works nicely. It&#39;s just that I cannot do anything with <code>Repo</code> after the DB transaction failed at the attempt to insert a duplicate key.
Wouldn&#39;t just removing the executable and not the object files it is comprised of, just force a re-link, not a re-compile? Thus not solving the problem.
I don&#39;t know the context for this question, but if you plan on doing more than just this operation on the array, you should map the array to <code>Date</code> objects (or ints representing time since Jan 1, 1970) and sort it first.
is there no way to split every 13 character after comma?
I think I&#39;m not making part of this clear. What src_check is, is not always the same. There are many different versions of src_check that can be processed, and there are many different rows for each src_check. I can&#39;t write a function for each one. Perhaps this is more clear with the second example, where I&#39;m pulling the string from a database table - that table has hundreds of rows and each string may or may not use one or more variables that come from the main script.

I am unable to post the project unfortunately. I attempted your suggestion and while no success, my content is still there which is a plus but the slide out does not work. I see where you are getting at with this though. Attempt to call ViewController with storyboard as opposed to the class itself.

Thanks for pointing that out. I did come across it earlier when I had that exact same issue but I was able to remove that item from source control, which fixed things. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;m currently experiencing is a variation on the same or something else but I do not see these items in source control (again, could they be &quot;hidden&quot;?)
It also looks like you are just checking if the answer to <code>Do you smoke a cigarettes?</code> is an upper case character and not whether or not it is a <code>Y</code> or <code>N</code>

OK, I don&#39;t know spark so there&#39;s lots of things in your code I don&#39;t understand.  Like: if <code>getHashtagEntities</code> returns <code>Unit</code>, how can you call <code>map</code> on it?  Whatever.  If the line before works then move the <code>length</code> call there.  What <code>map</code> returns should have a <code>lenght</code> method.

In that case, it looks like you lost the data, not just the format. If that&#39;s the case, we cannot get the data. Can you share a sample of what you have now ?
Could you edit the Codepen example to show how that would work perhaps?

) Why you use &quot;margin: -0.5rem;&quot; for t-news. I think that it is a bad pratice to add position for block. Only parent block can set position of it&#39;s child. Child block must have exact size.

It&#39;s worth pointing-out that modern <code>wsimport</code> tools do not generate code with a <code>get[Service]Port</code> method any more. Instead, call <code>get[Service]</code> and cast the resulting object to a <code>BindingProvider</code> to set these kinds of properties.

I can see that idea being useful somewhere A.I.. But I don&#39;t think you would get a good approximation unless the data was randomly distributed and you had multiple sets of data to perform an average on. If the data is not random there are too many factors that could cause the approximation to be wildly different.  As Keith pointed out, the huge advantage of the Axis Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) is that it gives you an easy calculation to short circuit your way out of the complex one.

Done. Do watch out for customers who get &quot;creative&quot; in the changes they make to your database. Most customers aren&#39;t too bad, but some can make a whole bunch of changes that interfere with the app itself. For those customers you might need to enforce a &quot;drop objects not found&quot;. Most times, I&#39;d avoid doing that as customers sometimes create helper procs/tables outside of your schema. :)
@S.Akbari several reasons: 1) to match title of the question, example with numbers was an illustration to the code in the question, 2) I always find it hard to understand code with multiple ordering (there are three here) in comparison with accepted answer. 3) accepted answer got more upvotes on the moment of accepting.

watch out what you&#39;ve done here: <code>void* a = (void*)50;</code> this declares <code>a</code> as a pointer to <code>void</code> and points it at memory address 50. It doesn&#39;t store 50 at the address pointed to by <code>a</code>, it makes <code>a</code> point to data at address 50, and 50 is almost certainly not a valid address for use. Usually the first couple thousand addresses are verboten and never used because it makes trapping accidental null pointer accesses easier. <code>*a = *b;</code> then assigns the data at a bad memory address to the data at another bad memory address, and BOOM
Obviously if you need the validate the whole string you might need to use the start and end delimiters - see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6298566/regex-match-whole-string" title="regex match whole string">stackoverflow.com/questions/6298566/regex-match-whole-string</a>

<code>someMethod</code> in the example you&#39;ve described appears to perform <i>two</i> roles, as opposed to one. Typically, I would do <code>someValidation</code> in a method, and if it passes, then <code>someMethod</code> otherwise keep working until <code>someValidation</code> passes. If you have a method <code>cutApple</code> that accepts Objects that are not Apple, but does nothing with non-apples, why not just verify the Object is an Apple before asking to cut it?

Do you have a question about some part of your program that is not working, or are you just asking for a general design review?  If it&#39;s the latter, that&#39;s not really on topic for SO.  In that case you should take a look over on the programmer&#39;s SE and see if it&#39;s on-topic there.

@miken the extended option is a bad choice. Because <code>Add</code> is not virtual if you access the list via a <code>List</code> instead of your <code>ListEx</code> you will not get your event raised. You really should use <code>ObservableCollection</code> or <code>BindingList</code> instead or if you are going to go with a extension, you need to extend <code>Collection&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code>, that one has a virtual <code>Add</code> method you can override.

I am afraid, I do not know enough about R to actually do that. I assume I have to create two dupesLists and then sapply twice? If I understand it correctly dupeVals is a list of all y values. dupesList is then creating a list of all x values who have duplicate y values. sapply is then calling lines on all x and all duplicate y values. I just do not understand how it calculates the x values.
Similar issue. The original file was generated on Google Console with a &quot;service account&quot;.  The json file has no &quot;web&quot; element and building the flow balks.

Disagree with &quot;in-band signaling 0&quot; problem.  Pascal, came out not much later than C.  It used a string length.  Possible other languages used a string length.  C survived - they did not.  (Beta is better than VHS - but it died).  Had C used the &quot;better&quot; explicit length, we might be complaining about <code>D</code> today  and not the forgotten C.  The null character solution worked well for the time.  Yes it is cumbersome today.  I hope for a standard C UTF8 string solution with a explicit use length and buffer size.
Thanks u_mulder! Your solution works!
Is there a reason behind the need of the <code>allowLargeResults</code> when using <code>flattenResults=false</code> ? Using <code>allowLargeResults</code> can increase the query time and forces you to define a destination table, which is pretty inconvenient in some cases.

Thank you very much for feedback. I have some questions:

Sorry, I&#39;m not a PHP expert, you should browse StackOverflow for related questions but doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s problem with javascript.

@DaniP Yes something like that! Thank you!
@Christoph I&#39;ve got a very large file with 20000 timesteps. Somehow gnuplot detects only 1001 blocks and stops the animation after that without throwing an exception. Do you have an idea what could be the problem?
@Grayson I mention that the recursion can then be used on each combination.
It&#39;s working, but since the tabs item is containing the pages in each tab, this forces all the second child divs below in the hierarchy to have <code>margin:auto</code>.

You only provide combinations, he also wants permutations. For each combination, which is an excellent approach btw, he will need to permute each of these.
That &quot;wait&quot; loop only gets you so far - in the &quot;old days&quot; of the web it would have been enough, but these days there&#39;s often dynamic content which gets loaded only <i>after</i> the main page content has completed.

It is likely that bootstrap&#39;s own <code>dropdown.js</code> has diverged enough in the 2+ years that this version no longer applies. The version linked above was for bootstrap v3.3.5. It looks like the eventing in 3.3.6 has changed a bit, I haven&#39;t tested against that version. Also, it surely won&#39;t work in 4.x.
It seems that <code>getPacklistItemLotSerial</code> function does some kind of aggregation and it returns multiple values combined into a comma  separated list. What you want is to split back that list into indyvidual values. The question is - why don&#39;t discard that function completely and include it&#39;s implementation directly into the query ? You can save a lot of overhead, I bet that this can be even 30-50 times faster (yes - 50 times = 5000%). Could you append a source code of this function to the question ?
Is <code>livesearch</code> an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>? If so, you might need to use <code>value</code> instead of <code>innerHTML</code>.
yes you are right @MarcB , I am using the same script for washington and that works but there is something wrong with lasvegas, I have seen the output for like 2 times after that it showing that error.
I looked at this example but it does not address my question. Its not using a Timespan, it uses a Time Difference (not sure what the difference is between the two though). And it does not show how to keep a Timespan (my timeout time) and compare that to a difference in timestamps. I&#39;ll check if Poco allow me to compare a timedifference with a timespan.

I want the class added to the .datepicker-title TH. The reason this shows only one datepicker is due to the fact that when you click on one input box, it will only show you one.

Yes, now I know ^ is the right operator. However as I mentioned I want to solve the sparse linear system using the package Eigen. So actually I want to first define a bool-valued matrix like Eigen :: Matrix ( m , n, BOOL), this BOOL is the bool type with the modified operator as you said. I don&#39;t know how to realise it.

well, for cli it&#39;d be all in argv, so do <code>var_dump($argv)</code> in the script and see what arrives. php hasn&#39;t changed command line processing interfaces at all, so there&#39;s no reason for (possibly) a php version upgrade to break something as simple as this.

False. Observers are a part of the documented guides for the latest Ember. They are not internal only. <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/object-model/observers/" rel="nofollow">guides.emberjs.com/v2.6.0/object-model/observers</a>  A computed property is not appropriate here as the property is never accessed therefore the computation will never occur. Since this is not a property of anything, an observer makes more sense to observe the change and act upon it.
2 options come to mind for me. Your first option, as you mentioned is to create different factories for each user role.  Then in your tests use context blocks to separate out each role.  So context &quot;as an admin&quot; ...  The other option is to assume all users are the highest level of access in your integration tests, and rely on your unit tests to validate that the permissions work.  Personally I would use the context blocks but I would make some executive decisions around which features actually need end to end testing(IE which ones are business critical).

did you try putting a delay, I think maybe this is the key to wanted behaviour.
start basic debugging: <code>var_dump($html, $get)</code> and see what the html looks like. just because it works for one page means absolutely nothing for another. it&#39;s a dynamically generated page and can be TOTALLY different with only minor changes in the url.
Thank you very much, I didn&#39;t even know serde had a working XML module. I did use serde_json before and really liked it.

I am getting compilation errors with <code>serde_macros</code>.
Are you talking about swapping the pointers or swapping the objects they point to?
I am afraid of title, so didn&#39;t dare to read details, I think answer is no.
The problem is that when you Add something to the database you&#39;ll have to manually set the navigation properties, while this mocking will save the object as it is. I wonder is there is a way to emulate EF&#39;s behaviour about this.
Noted and corrected.
@DanRosenstark if the SDK you are using is just passing you a pointer, you are in the clear.
in your game you should be transitioning between scenes. The same GameViewController presents both scenes. So a typical scenario might be... start on a MenuScene -&gt; transition to GameScene.

I tried the gcc-linaro toolchain as suggested by the manufacturer of the platform however, this worked successfully up until the &quot;make install&quot; phase - every time it failed to build all of the packages.

well, no, ajax is client-side, it sends an http request to the server much like the browser does when you navigate to a web page. it then returns plain text that gets sent to the ajax callback. so... the php needs to write something to the output in the same way you send html back for a normal page.

Am I the only one shocked by the sentence &quot;This is why C++ should just die and give way to Java.&quot; ?
that&#39;s invalid php anyways. you have a number of <code>&quot;</code> inside the string breaking the code. and you don&#39;t use regexes to mangle html. use DOM instead.
Also, you can profile your code to find where it&#39;s spending most of it&#39;s time.
This works if you are trying to eliminate the thumb highlight altogether, but what i want is to keep the thumb highlight so as to keep the design pattern true to android default, The problem is that the highlight stays in the horizontal plane, separate from the now vertical seekbar.

the problem seems to be the encoding, I kind of doubt EF can calculate a query with a parameter containing such symbols. Try to set the encoding of your column to unicode (either via connection string, fluent API or Data annotation).
That did it. Add it to the answer so I can select it please.
TreeSet and TreeMap does not use equals and hashCode methods anyway. They will be used for HashSet and HashMap. For this question, they are irrelevant.  Look at my answer for the correct fix. The fix is in the comparator.

This answer solved my problem and worked for me.I had a MS unit test project referencing another one of my assemblies and AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies() was not returning that assembly when running a test. I suspect that even though my unit tests were using code from that library the assembly may not have been showing up in &quot;GetAssemblies&quot; because of the way vs.net loads up a MS unit test project (class library) as compared to running a regular .exe application. Something to keep in mind if your code uses reflection and is failing your unit tests.
It depends on how exactly your code is structured, but my guess is that <code>buildUserObject()</code> is calling a local reference to <code>validate</code> and not the exported reference (which is the one that gets spied on).

Hmm, see I have something similar in that my index.html is in the path that I gave next to <code>root</code>. If it matters, I am using an absolute path, not a relative path. Could the <code>server_name</code> make a difference? Mines just states localhost, which I am not too sure what it indicates.

@u_mulder thank you for pointing this out. If i am right, ajax is server side and javascript client side. I thought if i would run a setinterval, javascript could read a variable from the ajax file and, if true, run a different function.

In this case Mocha chains returned promise with <code>then</code> <i>after</i> <code>$rootScope.$apply()</code> was called.

Interesting that you are having the opposite problem that most people have. The linq query is doing a sql compare (which is failing apparently), whereas the for loop is forcing the execution of the query into memory, then doing a .Net comparison. Usually the sql comparison is more forgiving because it is case insensitive by default.
@TomasH Thank you!
Why don&#39;t you use <code>Hashmap</code>  and <code>Scanner</code>? I thought you simply wanted to achieve the counting of character occurrences in the input string. - and I am suggesting doing it as I shown in my answer. Did you at least try this out?
I don&#39;t know PowerShell. If you have any function that i can use to convert xml to json then it would be of great help. Thank you.

Oh, I need to amend this short answer, because the &quot;can be very short&quot; is wrong. I&#39;ve now had half a cup of coffee + coding, and that statement is just wrong. Sorry. :)
I have two tables: &quot;TomorrowPatients&quot; &amp; &quot;TomorrowPatients_Temp&quot;. In the morning, we have a script that populates the TomorrowPatients table. After this population, the user can specify a &quot;roomnumber&quot; for each patient. When the user does this, the roomnumber is saved in the tomorrowpatients table. During the day, more patients may be added. If we run the same procedure we already have then the table will be cleared and we will lose all the specified &quot;roomnumbers&quot;. We need to be able to run something that will simply append the data to the table if there is a &quot;new&quot; patient and do nothing if not.
Right, thank you !
Thank you, it works!
You test the bounding boxes, if they overlap then you do the full polygon test. There&#39;s no approximation about it, the results are the same.

This is why you don&#39;t rely on Visual Studio tools to add your connection string. Learn how to create and enter in the string manually, so you understand the parameters, where they go, how they are used, and where they come from. The dialog is missing an entry for <code>SERVICE_NAME</code> or <code>SID</code>, and so cannot be used to accurately create a correct connection string.  <a href="https://www.connectionstrings.com/oracle" rel="nofollow">connectionstrings.com/oracle</a> is a good reference.

So rearrange things? You can actually use the input prompt to print things how you want, i.e. <code>c = input(str(a) + &#39;+&#39; + str(b) + &#39;= &#39;)</code> will both set c as you want and also print out <code>[a]+[b]= </code> and wait for user to finish the question. Code edited to do exactly that.

Nope, only 2 entries exist in the emulators /etc/hosts
there&#39;s a chicken and egg problem.  Until the TLS layer is set up, the client doesn&#39;t send any HTTP request, so there&#39;s no host header until after the TLS handshake.  The only thing with the server name is the SNI extension in the ClientHello packet.  If you DNAT you&#39;re changing the dest IP, so unless you&#39;re tunneling via the squid using IP-IP or similar, the destination is only in the SNI.  And you lose the port number - you;d need to DNAT to a different port on squid for each different port your router was DNATting.
What operating system are you using?

All view objects have the same lifecycle as enclosing activity or fragment has. Once activity is killed the whole view hierarchy is killed. You can persist data needed to recreate the view, it can be text, position, color, etc. but you can not persist the view itself, you will have to recreate it.
@MarcB It won&#39;t, it&#39;s only numbers but if it doesn&#39;t get a value then it returns NIL
I have updated the main method with this:    public static void main(String[] args) throws LangDetectException         {             LangDetectSample detector = new LangDetectSample();         Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);         System.out.print(&quot;Enter text: &quot;);         String input = scanner.nextLine();         String language = detector.detect(input);         System.out.print(language);      } - but then it creates an error based on the exception.
If you mean multiple users on multiple devices then you will need some sort of server-based database of messages and a way to present the messages for a specific user. (Along with security to prevent other users from spoofing and reading somebody else&#39;s messages, but that&#39;s a different topic.) On a single device you should only need to care about YOUR messages. (The messages for the current user.)
@Owyn In chrome at least, if you delete document.__proto__.createElement it reverts it back to native or absent, as applicable.
you can use str_replace() on the string received from database like:

Yes, you&#39;d still need to wrap this in the IF logic. Your original code didn&#39;t do anything to the string if there were no periods. And the blank is getting returned because 1-1=0.

Hrm.  Attempting to just do <code>curl -v ftp:&#47;&#47;ftp.omniture.com</code> works here, in terms of <i>connecting</i>.  <code>curl</code>&#39;s default anonymous login fails, as expected.  If even the above fails for you (<i>i.e.</i> no <code>-o</code> option), it suggests that your client machine can&#39;t resolve &quot;ftp.omniture.com&quot; to an IP address (here it resolves to 66.235.132.90), or otherwise doesn&#39;t have network/routing access to that IP address or port.  That&#39;s what the &quot;Connection timed out&quot; message suggests to me.

@Manny264 I&#39;ve tried migrating to Android Studio in the past but there are legacy OCR dependencies that don&#39;t play nice with gradle. Either way, as far as I know just getting the version number would be a far easier fix for me than going through the headache of trying to adapt it to android studio.
@chux: Yes, the C standard defines that const string literals that are not initializers always terminate with a 0 byte. However this <code>char hello[5] = &quot;hello&quot;;</code> is perfectly legal, but will not terminate with a 0 byte. As far as the standard library <code>str…</code> functions is concerned this is not a string of course. The borders of what a string is and what not are a bit blurry. IMHO the use of the in-band signalling 0 byte terminator was one of the worse decisions in the C design process. Sure, having to drag around the length explicitly is annoying, but it would have prevented so many security bugs.
okay try .. <code>containerViewController = UIStoryboard(name:&quot;main&quot;, bundle:nil).instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier(&quot;containerVC&quot;)</code> this is all from memory so fix type and names yourself please

I don&#39;t understand.  The <code>foo</code> function receives a constant reference and doesn&#39;t change the parameter.  Did I miss something?  The <code>m_t</code> is a member variable, and since <code>foo</code> is not a constant method, the <code>foo</code> method is allowed to change the variable.  What are you trying to show?
Note that your function is very inefficient. Check the use of APPEND.
what is preventing you to write a simple <code>sub-query</code>? <code>WHERE Number = SELECT MAX(Number) FROM Table</code>

<code>*p</code> is not guaranteed to be NULL after <code>freeaddrinfo()</code> is called. If <code>*p</code> is getting NULL&#39;ed then that is a side effect of the memory manager that allocated and is freeing <code>serveinfo</code>. Some memory managers <i>do</i> zero out memory when freeing it (or even fill it with special values like <code>0xcdcdcdcd</code> or <code>0xbaadfood</code> to aid debugging), but you can&#39;t rely on that behavior in your code.

Your code is right! This is my understanding, I do not know if it is right.So, at first, if any element wants to use a jquery method , it must become a jquery element , using $(&#39; &#39;).  Second, I can not use $(&#39;.list&#39;).append($(&#39;.div&#39;).addClass(&#39;item&#39;).html(toAdd)); . Is it because that .div is focusing on the div that already exist in the html?

Choose differing output names for columns that are the same. Consider a <code>cross join</code> to fold the variable in.
@RalphTandetzky I agree, used <code>std::forward_as_tuple</code>. Right.
There&#39;s also a <code>TNS_ADMIN</code> string value that should be defined in the registry at <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\ORACLE\KEY_OraClient11ghome1</code>, which would have the same path as the environmental variable.

Your sql has error &#39;id&#39; shouldn&#39;t be there like that. Utilize this method <code>INSERT INTO table_name (column1,column2,column3,...)

Thanks, and yes that makes sense. In fact, given that my data is 1D, it <i>should</i> just be the the intercepts that matter.   For the test data provided, the first and third intercept (2.5 and 4.5) are the correct decision boundaries, but I&#39;m unclear on how I would know that it&#39;s those two values and to ignore the second value returned by svc.intercept_. The data I&#39;m actually working with is more complex.
Browse for more comes up with no results
From my array, I&#39;m doing a <code>foreach</code> loop, with a split into a new variable, since the paths are all bunched up in the array. Once the variables are split into individual lines, in the code, I&#39;m doing this:  <code>$file | Get-Item | ForEach-Object {robocopy $_.Directory.Parent.FullName E:\TEMP $_.Name &#47;s}</code>  Now this works, but again, it loops through all the thousands of folders where the file that I need to copy is coming from, and eventually does copy that one file, but is really slow in doing so as a result.
To make this working, I need to hold the url range in a variable and replacing the text with that range. right?

Yes. The &quot;next&quot; is from a &quot;for each&quot; loop I used
Once you update your PHP file you can upload it to GCS bucket and then ssh into your running instances in the group and copy the file to these instances. The new instances created in the group through autoscaler will have the updated file if the name and path of the file is same in startup script. These steps for updating the file can be automated in a shell script.
Shouldn&#39;t it be <code>font-family: Raleway; font-weight: 500;</code>?
<code>fs.createWriteStream(null, { fd : 3 })</code> works just fine for me, provided (obviously) that the output is redirected using <code>3&gt;file.txt</code> (otherwise you <i>will</i> get a &quot;bad file descriptor&quot; error, but that&#39;s to be expected).
Not sure about this, as I don&#39;t know node.js -- but maybe this fits: the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API" rel="nofollow">Jenkins remote access API</a> indicates that the <code>parameter</code> entity in the json request must point to an <i>array</i>, even if there&#39;s just one parameter to be defined. Could something like this possibly fix the problem:<code>JSON.stringify({&quot;parameter&quot;: [ parameters ]})</code>
I got multiple projects that depend on each other. Usually I do clean and build for entire work space and that usually take care of everything.
Do you require that the polling be every 5 minutes or would it be sufficient if the first job of the day were detected with a granularity of 1 hour?
Thanks! BTW how would you call this in CSS to change the font?
This question should be migrated to the dba site of SE
I think <code>position: absolute;</code> i will use for menu__item__links and it will prevent moving the bottom elements.
I think the outputted file may actually be in the Docker image layer itself. I think this may be the case because I removed the <code>ADD file.txt</code> line and replaced it with <code>CMD [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;file.txt&quot;]</code>. I was able to build the image and run the container correctly, with it displaying &quot;blah blah bla..&quot;
No way around this because you could violate referential integrity if there was a way. Your design appears flawed @user3638992. Cross transaction access to the same data is really dangerous and brittle.
It&#39;s only roughly 70%. It highly depends on your &quot;country&quot; mix, where you are selling your apps. Go to an app &gt; Pricing and view the pricing matrix to see how much you get exactly in each country, e.g. in the EU you get ~ 58%, US ~ 70%, Australia ~ 62% etc.
@GrzegorzBlachliński Wow, very cool, that is exactly what I was looking for: thanks a lot!
This seems what i was looking for, but im new at this so i dont understand the &quot;cn.Ranges(1)&quot;, does it took the value of the cell(1,1) of the connection &quot;table&quot;?, assuming the connection made is a table imported on the sheet

OK, thanks for your help
the same image is used in the activity&#39;s image view and it is not pixelated shows up just right and can be used to set the wallpaper without quality loss but when done from a service there is quality loss
I already posted that I passed the <code>CommandParameter=&quot;{Binding ElementName=Locals1, Path=SelectedItem, Mode=TwoWay}&quot;</code> But no use.
Select your code and press the &quot;{}&quot; button in the editing toolbar (or as per the tooltip, press ctrl+K).
Okay, that is what I was thinking. Yeah unfortunately I have to clone a repo online and utilize that, and that repo is Nginx 1.8. I looked at the link that you referred, but it looks like none of the suggestions from the correct answer applies since none of them are issues for me. Thanks for the link though!
you mean <code>yourList.split()</code>?
I changed the map to a forEach and just appended the dom nodes to an array. Best not to use map if you don&#39;t return a 1:1 amount of things for the list of iteration
yeah... new request should be generated if they click
This suggestion looks like it&#39;s getting me closer:  <code>\\SERVER\FOLDER1\FOLDER2\FILE.TXT&#39;, ... | Get-Item | ForEach-Object {robocopy $_.Directory.Parent.FullName E:\TEMP $_.Name &#47;s}</code>  The caveat is when I run this in my code, it looks like it&#39;s somehow trying to search or loop through every single folder in the relative path where this file is -- of which there are thousands of folders -- instead of just getting the specific file and the specific folder it&#39;s in, ignoring everything else. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s, obviously, still something I&#39;m not understanding. (continued in next comment)
But if I pass a string: VQAL1-SQ994.1, then is passes a blank value. When it is supposed to pass everything to the left of the period. And if I pass a string that does not contains a period: VQAL1-SQ994, then it throws a message: Invalid length parameter passed to the LEFT or SUBSTRING function.
By &quot;non temporary tables&quot; , do you mean the table you are inserting into ? That is, the &quot;MyTable&quot; I have used in my answer ?
@usr Thanks usr.  I can definitely do that and know how to do that.  My OP is really to see if I can simplify that kind of design to be more generic.  Since I might have 20 things in the code that I need to synchronize i&#39;d like to have a common lock utility that I can say hey, here&#39;s some unique code, make sure only one person runs it at a time.  Instead of littering the code and putting that effort on other people.
Are you starting ti with <code>manage.py runserver</code>? Also <code>settings.py</code> (removing personal info) and django version (we can guess the python version from your error) are a must for anyone to be able to help.  <code>from django.db.models import signals</code> works perfectly form me with the latest dajngo (1.10).
&quot;Statement reification&quot; is a specific kind of reification that is a statement about a statement, using <code>rdf:subject</code>, <code>rdf:predcate</code>, and <code>rdf:object</code>.  It&#39;s often defined as a member of <code>rdf:Statement</code>, hence the term &quot;statement reification&quot;.  I was being clear that this kind of reification is not needed, contrary to one of the comments.
Hint: use Qt Creator autocomplete to fill out the SIGNAL and SLOT macros. If it refuses, there&#39;s a problem somewhere. If it does autocompletion, you avoid potential typo bugs.
Sorry to resurrect this topic, but what is the API documentation on GeoXML3? I would like to know the available constructs and methods (just like Java API documentation, if you know what I mean).
Thank you very much for your answer! As i said in other comments it&#39;s not really homework, I&#39;m preparing for the exam to joining a university and this was given in 2010, but you are right I need layman&#39;s explanation. In your answer I could help but notice you had two small mistakes:1. the code scans more than n numbers , it scans until it finds n GOOD/fit numbers (it scans 7 but dismisses it for example) and removing factors isn&#39;t a linear process. For example 2 ^100 would take 100 steps in that algorithm , not 2 ^100. Also could you give a very brief  explanation on what a sieve is?
the UIViewController is a wrapper for your scenes. you can&#39;t leave a scene and go to the ViewController. you can however access the ViewController and it&#39;s functions.
@tdelaney: fits takes indeed a lot of CPU power, maybe I will only use mproc for the heavy work and leave the file opening outside.
@NicolBolas, My mistake. I tied them more closely because fold expressions were primarily introduced to support Concepts. It&#39;s good to see them going in separately.
I don&#39;t have git or mvn, but if I try with <code>dir</code>, the output is fine. Which OS is it exactly?
GNU Parallel is amazing and initially I was using that only but I noticed that using <code>&amp;</code> is more time efficient.
What have you tried so far? For your information you can remove the nested query making it more efficient by simply doing <code>SELECT * FROM TABLE where ID=10 group by LOCATION order by DATE desc</code>
I&#39;m still thinking of a simple solution but what is wrong with your code is that you have 1 &lt;p&gt; and you want to apply a css class to a part of a &lt;P&gt;. The only way I see it at the moment is : 1- You split your phrase in a word array 2- You remove from dom the &lt;p&gt; containing your sentence 3- You create a new &lt;p&gt; for every words with the class when needed and add it back to the dom. Will test if this works.
This should be given as it&#39;s own question, and not as an answer to another.
But how would I invoke a particular action. Should I have a factory method to get the objects? Like if it is a VerifyAction, how would I get the VerifyAction class?
Yea that sounds a lot easier. Thanks!
Use: select CONCAT( &#39;damit **&#39;,  DATEDIFF...)

Thank you this helped!
Since the shape of matrix B is not (4,5), how will you deal with the last element of each row in matrix A?  Regardless, if you just want to get values for any element in an array with the structure you have provided, the following will work: list(A[0][0].values())[0].  But I really think you should consider using a more appropriate data structure.

I see you updated your question with namespaces you <i>use</i> but do you have <code>&lt;?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;</code> in PostController.php?
@chris: Fold expressions are not part of concepts. And they were already voted into C++17 (though they are undergoing modifications).
Yes, I searched for this error but didn&#39;t find any solution.
@Ulozilla No those do not need to be marked. Only thing explicitly created by your app. We were also worried about preference, cookie, and cache files automatically created for each app, but those also do not need anything special to be set.
This regex partially works, it doesn&#39;t solve sequential blank entries, for example ,,,, will be ,\n,,\n, Should be usable if you run it twice
You probably need some low level I/O drivers. There is a good chance your light/lamp is not even getting detected, let alone being recognised by the OS.
you can use wildcard validation
Thanks! I agree that OPs problem would likely be solved if they fixed their dependencies, however the core of the question is actually kind of interesting: If a .h file is changed, force a rebuild. This is something I don&#39;t know off-hand how to do, and would be interested in seeing someone answer. forcing a &quot;make clean&quot; before building is kind of a sledgehammer approach.
<code>$(&#39;&lt;div &#47;&gt;&#39;)</code> is ok to create new div.

I have never used map lib so far. I was reading about it but I couldn&#39;t figure out how to use it, can you be more specific ?   For example: when I want to insert in the graph , I&#39;ll use   map&lt;int,string&gt; x = {1, city}    graph-&gt;insert(x)
It does NOT change the language level of your Intellij project. Please have a look to the answer I have posted. But I remember well that it is the case in Eclipse. But here the question here is on Intellij.
@coding22 good to hear, could you accept the answer if it works? thanks :]
I would say the starting point should definitely be webworkers as 1) the calculation is not UI related, so it should not be on the main thread, and 2) the method takes more than 0.5-1 seconds, so it shouldn&#39;t be on the UI thread for a second reason. 3) I&#39;m imagining chrome is killing the calc because it&#39;s on the main thread where it has heavy restrictions, whereas if it were on a background thread, chrome would be more lenient.
Yea, but it took him 30 minutes.  That&#39;s crap...

What happened? Can you describe the issue now?
I actually tried it with the &quot;+ 2&quot; aspect and it works however without it, it doesn&#39;t seem to copy the parent cell color scheme.
In this vein, you may want to look at &quot;debounce&quot; functions that will wait for input to stop for you.
you should use just color: black; text-color is not a css property

@Azaryan Your question links to <a href="https://www.softcover.io/" rel="nofollow">softcover.io</a>, but doesn&#39;t even mention github.  So, your comment is in direct contradiction with the question that you posed.  I&#39;d suggest that you make a correction and clear that up.  It is crucially important that you are precise and clear about what you&#39;re doing and what you expect.  Since there was <b>no code</b> presented, and no question about programming, there&#39;s little that can be done for you here on StackOverflow.  That&#39;s why 4 others agreed that the question should be closed as <i>off-topic</i>.

Thanks. My initial layout was something like this, It should work but it wasn&#39;t . So I looked up in the hierarchy, one of the parent linear layout was set as width: WRAP_CONTENT, and one of it&#39;s child had a fixed width. So this weird wrapping error occurred. I updated my answer.
Will this work even if the data has changed in the non-temporary table. After the initial load of data the user can manipulate what &#39;Room&#39; the record is in and this will mean it will NOT be the exact same row in the temp as in the non-temp tables

There&#39;s no need to go and call me out for that edit in your question, because that is not relevant to the question.

it depends on how complicated the query is, but as a rule of thumb always try doing the following in frontend: send the request only if changes have been made actually + introduce a delay after watching for keyboard/mouse actions. e.g. if you&#39;re implementing a search-as-you-type, add something like 200-300ms delay before performing actual search.

Is it possible that you are just not putting it under enough load to force the use of both servers? I would think that it needs to have a lot of clients hitting it at the same time, under load. I mean just a simple implementation of signalr can handle millions of messages a second.

There&#39;s no need to be mean. OP doesn&#39;t know the difference between Javascript and jQuery -- so tell them! (jQuery is a Javascript library used for DOM manipulation and AJAX). As for the other comment, yes, you do need to benchmark. It&#39;s impossible for us to tell how fast something will be without code to benchmark. Besides that, I&#39;m curious: why do you need to hit the database every time the GUI is updated?
@stenci: The second line can <i>only</i> delete the given directory. It does so recursively, indeed, but it <i>cannot</i> delete a file. Therefore, to remove everything inside a directory you have to remove all files, and all directories. Note that this is <i>not</i> about deleting a single directory and everything within. It&#39;s about deleting everything within and <i>keeping</i> the parent directory.

Would this cause a memory leak with instances of TAcroPdf?  Maybe the interface&#39;s incremented reference count (_AddRef) is ignored when freeing the object reference.  Don&#39;t call _Release prior to freeing the object reference.  When I did I again got the access violation.
No problem. Glad it helped.
Type of Name is varchar. And no, there is no reason to use varchar.
The Tomcat docs say the &lt;Valve /&gt; element can go within the &lt;Engine /&gt;, &lt;Host /&gt; or &lt;Context /&gt; elements in server.xml. For me putting the valve within the &lt;Engine /&gt; element didn&#39;t work but putting it inside individual &lt;Host /&gt; elements did.  The docs also say Tomcat routes any non matching host names to the &lt;Host /&gt; element that is set in the defaultHost attribute of the &lt;Engine /&gt; element. To ensure that URLs to locations outside of your hosts/contexts are not shown the error messages compiled into Tomcat you need to make sure this &lt;Valve /&gt; is added your default &lt;Host /&gt;.

What you have looks correct now. If you pass in a string with 3 periods in it, you&#39;ll get the first 2 characters of the string you passed in. If the string you pass in has 22 periods, you&#39;ll get the first 21 characters, etc. It mimics what the VBA code you posted does.
then this code does exactly that. How could it not work? the logic is reasonable to  me here. Did you set both clicked bool to be false at first place?
that is a sample code for one of my buttons
Then it&#39;s not working, but the z-index not prevent moving the h2 element to the right side
I doubt that any changes should be done to Asterisk config files. Try to restart server and do not change any environment variables, after this check if safe_asterisk still writes to DB, if not then you are still missing config of ODBC. Check this manual: <a href="http://docs.adaptivecomputing.com/8-1-0/basic/Content/topics/moabWorkloadManager/topics/databases/oracle.html" rel="nofollow">docs.adaptivecomputing.com/8-1-0/basic/Content/topics/&hellip;</a> . Please take a look on steps 9, 10, 11. So you will need to create script which will load ENV variables on start-up of server + you will need to update init.d script. Make sure that you have tnsnames.ora file properly configured.
The argument type <code>T</code> is contravariant in <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>callback</code> is in a contravariant position, so you have a contravariant parameter in a contravariant position, which is covariant.

One thing came to mind when looking at Crypto++ <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>: you could consider posting a minimal version of it on <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask">SE Code Review</a>. I think it makes a good example of cross-platform code with some special handling for certain platforms.
If I understand you right, that wouldn&#39;t solve the problem, because I had to call my method in activity class as well :/ And that means, that the method would be called always in onCreate of my Activity
I edit the answer
Dude, the ANTIALIAS made a huge difference! Thanks! =D
Do you know how I can do this in OS X instead of iOS?
The accepted answer says how not to get the __MACOSX/ directory in the first place, but says nothing about what to do with an existing .zip file. This answer says how to get rid of __MACOSX/ if you&#39;ve already got it. However, the original question was how not to get it in the first place, so the accepted answer is the correct one.
To be honest, this seems to be the most appropiate to what I&#39;m looking for. Still, It retuns undefined and I don&#39;t get why...
Yeah, sorry about that, I edited it.
Okay, I will change my answer a bit... Maybe it&#39;ll make sense then.
What is wrong with the method you have demonstrated?  Also - what is your use case? <code>LocalDate</code> may be more suitable.
did you remove all the old inputs that is an array? I was able to reproduce the error and in my case it was the old(&#39;input&#39;) call that caused it.
@Mohamed Right click the database project on Solution Explorer, select <b>Publish</b>, then click the <b>Advanced</b> button. On the new window, go to the Drop tab, check the first option: <b>Drop objects in target but not in source</b>. Just be aware that now everything not in source will be dropped by default, so you&#39;ll have to manually check which objects you need not to be dropped.
it still doesn&#39;t work
And don&#39;t forget that TCP is a byte stream, there is no guarantee that you will send an entire command in a single <code>send()</code> call, or that you will receive an entire response in a single <code>recv()</code> call. You have to keep sending until you have nothing left to send, and you have to keep reading until you encounter the <code>\r\n</code> that terminates each line. And you also have to take into account that an SMTP response may have multiple lines, so you have to actually parse the responses to detect that. The actual format of the responses is outlined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321" rel="nofollow">RFC 5321</a>.

Though this explanation clearly expresses the general concept of postfix decrement, it&#39;s at odds with EricLippert&#39;s detailed explanation of prefix &amp; postfix operators (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3346729/1245420">stackoverflow.com/a/3346729/1245420</a>). If Eric is to be believed, <code>Function(oldValueOf_y)</code> is called <b>AFTER</b> the variable known as <code>y</code> is decremented. What is passed to <code>Function()</code> is a copy of <code>y</code> before it was decremented. Thus it would seem that in C#, just as in C++, the semantics of postfix increment/decrement prevent obvious optimizations that the compiler may be able to make with prefix increment/decrement.

I have images of what the actual generated code looks like, plus the code that I have added within the jQuery. I will add them to the above post.
So you mean that it would be better to use the providers directly? I would really like to keep the interface. I know the code gets more obscure, but I&#39;m trying to build a custom control with general functionalities regardless the type of DB. Nonetheless I will give it a second thought. Thanks!

grouping by one field is valid in mysql, not in sql-server.. the 2 tags had me confused..
Also I don&#39;t know if this is to be edited but there is a file named nginx.conf.default that looks just like nginx.conf. The only difference is that everytime I build/make nginx, this nginx.conf.default goes back to its default values ( so even if I change the path, if I want to make the new binary file and build nginx, my changes go away). Do you think I should be spending more time focusing on this nginx.conf.default file and making changes there?
Well that&#39;s the thing--it just grabs the comments replies to them and that&#39;s it.
It was fun. AVAudioEngine is cool!
You can mitigate risk of physical recovery with full disk encryption.  In a virtualized server environment this is not a commonly considered measure (but still valuable when the hypervisor is breached). Alternatively, mount a ramdisk and put the tempfiles on it.  Now the OS treats it like filesystem but stores it in RAM.
no press one and then press another. It doesnt matter which one is first or second.

Doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with Identity specifically, just generics. <code>UserManager</code> is generic, but the default implementation Identity scaffolds for you removes the generic by implementing <code>UserManager&lt;ApplicationUser&gt;</code>. You just need to modify this class to remain generic. See update above.

Well, yes, it&#39;s possible to pass a collection to a view (as that view&#39;s model), display a single item from that collection, and pass the collection to another child view.  Start by creating a view, passing it a collection, and displaying an item from within that collection.  Don&#39;t even worry about the child view until you can successfully make the main view.
xcode restart solved it, your solution works perfect. I see the same tiny increase. Thank you very very much!
what you mean is it is not possible to store textview information directly in shared preferences?
In truth, array is an excellent way to implement stack and queue whenever you can put a reasonable maximum size on the data structure. If you know that your stack will never contain more than 100 items, then allocating an array of size 100 is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Same goes for queue. Many real-world problems include such known limits.

As I said flush can be called many times , it doesn&#39;t affect anything, see the thing is output streams are already buffered streams and will be flushed time to time automatically, and at the time of closing as well.

Nah, I&#39;m just teasing you. Good answer. :)
The __MACOSX/ subdirectory contains Mac resource forks and is created when you use Mac tools to create the zip file. Likewise, Mac tools will consume the __MACOSX/ subdirectory in order to set resource forks, and you&#39;ll never even see it. However, if you use Mac tools to create the zip file and some other tools to unpack it, you&#39;ll get the __MACOSX/ directory and not the resource forks. If you create the file with <code>zip</code>, which is a 3rd-party app, then the __MACOSX/ directory never gets created in the first place.
That would be great, since my code is based on an tutorial. so maybe your way could be simpler and better to understand.

@LawrenceDeanVanderpool That&#39;s because I had updated the url when Moses Koledoye asked me to try doing so. I forgot to update the error message.
No. That is what I think we are missing is the post back portion.  The Select is not wrapped in form tag because we are populating subsequent dropdown lists on jQuery change events and calling our next controller method to populate another dropdown list based on the value of the previous.  If that makes sense.  DropDownListFor includes the Model properties, but I don&#39;t know how to populate a DropDownListFor based on a previous select on an onchange event.
Thanks. I cleaned up a couple things (added comma, changed attendees_table.max_attendees to weekends_table.max_attendees) and both of these got me the same result as Jeff&#39;s answer.

The goal is to get a list of <i>all</i> weekends that have openings left, including those with nobody yet signed up.
@adrenom that&#39;s strange, I tested it and works, have you tried different color combinations?

Do you have a @subscriber object when you render <code>form_for</code>?
I agree, if you&#39;re used to programming imperatively, it&#39;s hard to think relationally. It takes some practice. Instead of thinking about telling the computer what to do to get to the answer, you want to describe the relationship between the variables. See the question and solutions I linked as examples.
That said, you are not breaking the loop if <code>recv()</code> fails. And your 2nd <code>printf()</code> when <code>iResult &gt; 0</code> is assuming that <code>recvbuf</code> is null-terminated, which is not actually the case. You need to take <code>iResult</code> into account, eg: <code>iResult = recv(ConnectSocket, recvbuf, recvbuflen-1, 0); ... recvbuf[iResult] = 0; printf(&quot;messaggio: %s\n&quot;, recvbuf);</code> or <code>iResult = recv(ConnectSocket, recvbuf, recvbuflen, 0); ... printf(&quot;messaggio: %.*s\n&quot;, iResult, recvbuf);</code>

So @Lee ,  the parameter R of the interface is covariant, as can be seen from the out keyword. But it is converted to contravariant as it is passed to Action.

@Barmar  or if anyone else has any other suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated! :)
@DropTheChair Edited my anwser to fit your need.
I suggest to benchmark the cudaMemcpy2DAsync code and the thrust transformation code and maybe a regular CUDA kernel for the transform. PCIe has a high overhead when performing small transfers and that cudaMemcpy2DAsync will potentially do the copy with many ineffective 12 byte transfers. PCIe bandwidth is also significantly lower than GPU DRAM bandwidth. Copying the data with a regular gapless 1D transfer and then using a kernel to transform the data to 4 floats could easily be faster than the cudaMemcpy2DAsync transfer.
Ok, So I removed Plant from the Select and it might be working. I need to go back and do some math, but you may have provided that second set of eyes

Those might be fitted values. &quot;Estimates&quot; pertain to parameters of the model, not observations.
Yes, I am thinking to use dynamic dns. So i dont need to pay fee for static address for my endpoints. But if i use it, i cant use my endpoints locally without internet connection. If ssl gives  an option for multiple common name or not checking common name, that would solve my problem.

exception Queue.Empty: is an invalid syntax. Can you help me with this?
Nope, you really need to <code>yield gen.sleep(interval)</code> during the loop iteration if you want to sleep in a non-blocking manner while looping. If you decorate your <code>do_intervals</code> with <code>gen.coroutine</code> and follow the rest of my instructions it&#39;ll work as you want. I&#39;ve updated my answer to be clearer.
It&#39;s very possible it does not compile as C.

Hmm. <code>collect</code> typechecks but does it do what you want? It essentially depends on the <code>collect</code> from <code>Distributive Identity</code>, right?
It returns pending $q promise that remains unsettled until $rootScope.$apply() is called, i.e. forever. Chai-as-promise chains this pending promise, and its <code>then</code> callback is never called, too. $q promises are tied to Angular digests, this allows them to be synchronous. Any other promises are asynchronous. So if this means that $q is not &#39;compliant&#39;, that&#39;s it.

Where did this init program come from?  Is it part of an old rootfs?  You mention building a toolchain and kernel, but what about the complete rootfs?
the error was coming from this line that you had me add:Set objActiveWkbk = objXL.Application.Workbooks.Open FullPath which I changed to say this: objXL.Application.Workbooks.Open FullPath after it threw a syntax error on that line. After I changed it, it still didn&#39;t work, saying that something was wrong with this line: Range(&quot;&#39;owssvr&#39;!A1:O18&quot;).CopyPicture.
What does using <code>curl</code> with the verbose option show, <i>i.e.</i>: <code>curl -v ftp:&#47;&#47;ftp.omniture.com --user myname:mypassword -o a_file.zip</code> show?
Thanks very much. Just incase you are copying the code from this answer, don&#39;t.  Go to gitHub for the latest version, I have made some changes and fixes since this answer.
done, thanks. if you get a better answer, you can accept that if you wish :)
<code>df$estimate &lt;- predict(lm(y~x,data=df))</code>
Don&#39;t do it on the form. That can be spoofed. Update the model with the information in the controller before saving changes. Assuming you are requiring authentication of some kind you&#39;ll have the information easily available.
Absolutely, there is not going to be any sound.  Just video.

<b>Note to close voters:</b> This is not a request for resource recommendations, but rather a plea for help finding a link to a specific piece of hard-to-find documentation.

Error 10058 is <code>WSAESHUTDOWN</code>, which DOES NOT mean the <b>server</b> shut down the connection, it means <b>you</b> shut it down: &quot;<i>The socket has been shut down; it is not possible to send on a socket after <code>shutdown</code> has been invoked with <code>how</code> set to <code>SD_SEND</code> or <code>SD_BOTH</code></i>&quot;. If the <b>server</b> had shut down the connection, you would be getting a different error instead. In the code you have shown, <code>shutdown()</code> is commented out, so there is no possible way that <code>send()</code> can be failing with <code>WSAESHUTDOWN</code>.
@ZainabMurtaza That is a completely different question from what you asked...

@ TessellatingHeckler what is Echo server? and what is a keylogger ? @cricket_007
Note that the configuration is probably in your user directory, so if you copied your user data from a previous computer (manually or with Apple&#39;s migration assistant), and if you already had Intellij + Scala plugin installed on the old computer, you may have carried over an old setting? If there is no existing user setting at all, the default is definitely &quot;Bundled&quot;.
Also you can try x32bit interop together with x32bit Office ;)

@PyThon what about flush?
Interesting thing happened - I am going to create a separate answer .. but will award to you.
PERFECT! Ran like a charm. Thank you, much appreciated, including the tag change
@Holger thank you very much! I&#39;ll close this as a duplicate. Your answer explains everything, and also seems to answer my second question: it would be possible to keep the laziness, and this is a known limitation of the current implementation.
Tried to make sense of the code block and make it readable
Finally I have compiled all your code in the first important function hooked <code>in woocommerce_check_cart_items</code>. Without php comments, it takes only 20 lines... and it does the same thing as your code do. Everything is more clear now. I think i have find what is the problem… I will re update my answer, soon.
well..i didn&#39;t open it spring did
Can you add which version of the sbt plugins you are using in that plugin project?
I have a question, do you know how to achieve that the replacement be hold only for the specific words, this implementation is replacing the string X  in every part of the text area like in the word: GJHGXA.NAYE, I would like to ignore this cases only making the replace if it mach with complete words I am spliting the information by the pipes and the &quot;~&quot; symbol.
The value of one of your fields might contain a quote: <code>&#39;</code>, which would make the query invalid. Please bind your variables, like @aynber suggested.
This is probably pretty basic but I am not even sure whether the way I am trying to fit a logarithmic model is correct (e.g. do I need to also take log(y) and is it okay to add a small constant only to all entries that are &#39;0&#39; or should I add the same constant to every entry?)
I like this idea, and in fact I&#39;ve considered it. Here&#39;s a question: would this provide an approximation of the intersection area as opposed to an exact number? Ie the finest bounding box would decide the approximation of the intersection area?
@Gunderson thanks for the comment as well! Yes, I&#39;m actually using mocha which captures the time of the <code>it</code> block as you have mentioned, but I don&#39;t want to include the assertion in my time. I&#39;ve thought about moving the assertion outside of the <code>it</code> block to address this, but it would make my code less pretty :(
I get the following for each field not in the group by clause.  Column &#39;IBSCM01.stage.MB52.Plant&#39; is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.
@MosesKoledoye, thanks and vote up. I update my post with update 5 for screen snapshot for installed packages, it seems tensorflow is not there (I scroll down and list all packages starts with letter &#39;t&#39;).

I works excelent .. if I choose the contact that posses email address, otherwise contact apllication hang on, black screeen and nothing happend. I&#39;m using HTC lolipop
Is there a reason you don&#39;t sort the results as part of your query that gets the data?
yes, you are right, only one thread will exit.

I see, yeah, it profiles VBA Coding, I misunderstood that you were trying to profile the routines for connections in your code, to look which ones were the slower, my bad.

@DRapp....Ok, so you agree that it makes sense to add another table with this info. Thanks for your continued input and help here
Thanks, this is a good start. But it gives me only the weekends that have at least <i>one</i> attendee. So, I have two weekends with <i>zero</i> attendees and these do not show up in the list. That&#39;s the main reason I had to do it in PHP. It seems like the <code>COUNT</code> is acting as a filter on events with zero attendees, since it can only do a <code>JOIN</code> if it finds at least one attendee.
The line <i>&quot;I am trying to enter a file path in command line and then run an executable on them...&quot;</i> makes me believe this is <i>not</i> what the OP wants, he wants command line args.
sorry but i&#39;m not sure what a dynamic query is
I did. This in no way explains how to accomplish OPs goals. It&#39;s sound advice but it&#39;s not an answer.
i need to pass the search index also where can put search index in above json?

@TessellatingHeckler Yes, they are. I just hadn&#39;t had much experience with that before. Proved to be a very simple solution. See below.
One problem i&#39;m facing from the beginning is, the system has to display the addition operation on executing. for example, 20+30=ask user to enter answer[user input]

Just a quick tip. If you want something like this <code>aasdf</code>, then you should put ,` ,before the start of the text and in the end.
See the update to my answer.. there is a huge difference.
frankly this is better practice than relying on Reflection for implementation
actually I think you should rethink if overriding is really what you want, as <code>TSubclassOf&lt;AItem&gt;</code> and <code>TSubclassOf&lt;AWeapon&gt;</code> are two distinct types

I am glad to hear that and thanks for accepting. There are other methods you can use, for example bucketing by range but general idea is always the same - instead of performing brute force search over Cartesian identify possible candidates first.

@RidgeRobinson, see revised table structures...
@YuZhang thanks for the comment! The problem with inserting time_begin and time_end variables in the commented lines to measure time is that protractor hasn&#39;t actually performed any operations yet since they are promises that get added to the control flow queue. So the timer will start and stop immediately, which isn&#39;t useful.

first is not working becouse after <code>..&#47;..&#47;</code> you will be behind the root directory (<code>public_html&#47;..&#47;</code> is <code>root</code>, <code>public_html&#47;..&#47;..&#47;</code> is parent of <code>root</code>).
@cpburnz I have added some info... hope it clarifies.
nope, been there, done that ;)
Oh I just realized that. I changed it to a var. But is my comment above yours the way to update that <code>accum</code> variable?
Your long <code>schaererDataSorted</code> lines scare off the help.  :)
You are not answering my question. I could maybe work around it that way in HTML but in PDF I could not get it to work. I guess its CSS support is not strong enough to do it. Forcing a square logo is in any case just really bad system design - at least without giving the option of choosing between the two formats.

Sorry, I thought the &quot;run Fedora on a R-Pi and use a TFT display on it?&quot; bit was self evident. PiTFT displays are for the Raspberry Pi. I have a raspberry pi 3 model B that is running Fedora 23 as a OS, and I&#39;m attempting to get display output through a 3.2&quot; PiTFT monitor. My question was general on purpose and remains the same. I would like to know if anyone has gotten &quot;any&quot; TFT based screens working with RPi in tandem with Fedora as the OS, as I&#39;m looking for a place to start. A proper, exact solution goes beyond the usual scope of stackoverflow. :P
What is your goal?  What problem are you trying to solve?  Why are you running <code>top</code> non-interactively?  There almost certainly is a better method to go about doing what you&#39;re trying to do.

I don&#39;t think this is a duplicate.  Not every plot is a raw image.  For example, if we start with a simple <code>plot(x, y)</code>, it is not clear at all how one could save that as <code>tif</code> with PIL/Pillow.
What specifically do you not know how to do? Do you know how to read in from the console, do you know how to write out to the console?

@TWilly yes, you will need to create a date object.

When you construct the adapter, it looks like you&#39;re passing in the current state of the data.  With the other data (network) accessing methods, it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re passing in any of the updated state to the adapter.
Great answer.  I suggest you add another code block for the flag &quot;-v&quot; option though.  As my eyes read the answer they immediately went to the code blocks and not the text surrounding it.  If others do the same they&#39;ll miss the &quot;-v&quot; portion.

I am not sure that avoiding flattening (conversion to polygons) is feasible. Indeed, the intersection equations are not analytically solvable and you&#39;ll have to sample the outlines anyway (admittedly in a non-uniform way). By dropping it willingly, you loose the safety of topological correctness possible with polygons.
Amazing stuff! Works like a charm
How would I verify?  I think you are right.  I ran <code>bash</code> and then reran the source on <code>.bash_profile</code> and it seems to have worked.  I&#39;m not sure what it was running if it wasn&#39;t Bash.  Thanks
@Dr.Jukka , I&#39;ve already used the MyWiFiMesh app, and I can&#39;t get the two devices to connect to each other. Is it necessary to start the application in both devices at the same time, or do I have to install or root the mobile to let it work? Thank you for your help.
You case use <code>DEFAULT</code> instead of <code>NULL</code>.
Variance applies to generic type parameters, so it is <code>R</code> which is covariant in <code>ICovariant</code>. Contravariance reverses the sub/supertype relationship, and the parameter types of <code>Action</code> delegates are contravariant. The use of a contravariant parameter in a contravariant position is covariant as the ordering is reversed and then reversed again.
<code>&quot;could you suggest a way to implement my requirement&quot;</code> - That&#39;s a <i>very</i> broad question.  Stack Overflow can help answer specific questions, but not provide you with entire tutorials custom-made for your needs.  What you have here, quite honestly, is a mess of code that won&#39;t work for multiple reasons.  &quot;Implementing your requirement&quot; isn&#39;t going to happen until you get a handle on the basics.  Don&#39;t just dive in and build a complex page with no experience.  Start small and build up to it, one small feature at a time.
Good point.  Before I do this, I will review the other tables and see if I have another method of accomplishing the same goal.  Thanks for the encouragement and help.  I do appreciate it.
Ill try it, but it seems really performance intensive
Got it . Thanks again . Will do!
If the original <code>coo</code> is built from a dense array, that <code>duplicate entry</code> feature (I happen to like it) isn&#39;t an issue.   It arises only when you build the <code>coo</code> from &#39;raw&#39; data, row, col arrays.
@Russ in your <code>GET</code> query example you&#39;re using <code>p4</code> (lowercase &quot;p&quot;) as parameter, not <code>P4</code> (uppercase &quot;P&quot;). I have no idea why what would yield a result where <code>product</code> is set to <code>P10</code> (assuming that you don&#39;t have any weird Mongoose middleware active).
I repeat - what <code>===</code> means?
Added it as an answer, please accept it if it works. Thanks
You don&#39;t need the first and - just try &quot;left join dataX (where = (two = 2 and six = 6 and CD ~= &quot;DVD&quot; and ...))&quot;
The reason it gets printed out to the client is in cases where the failure is at such a low level that it cannot be logged (e.g. if there&#39;s a bug in the logging code itself).
Output without Sample Data doesnt help us to understand your problem
There are too many potential answers to this question. Do you want to sort the data before you build the table or do you actually want a table where you can click a header to sort?
Yeah, ideally just see the user registration edit page again.
@Sgdva that profiles VBA code? I&#39;m looking to profile Power Query code. While I&#39;m using VBA do to so, profiling the VBA code itself doesn&#39;t help me. That&#39;d be like profiling the profiler.
Is the snippet perhaps missing something between <code>}</code> and <code>[</code>?
<code>LISTAGG</code> works perfect! Just read the document linked here. <code>wm_concat</code> removed from version 12c onwards.

And here&#39;s a sample output:   studentID array: 1, 0, 7, 4, 9 randomNum array: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 9, 11, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 19 1 was found in the random array 7 was found in the random array
the url would be something like: <code>username@yourIP:&#47;path&#47;to&#47;git</code>
Without access to the code, how did you write it to a text file?
This is what fixed it for me - mine got stuck on &quot;processing assemblies&quot; seemingly for random, different assemblies every time. I searched for &quot;SolutionCaches&quot; in that folder and deleted the contents of each result. Seems to be fixed now.
There could be a limit on your MySQL installation, but not one inherently with PHP. More information is at <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/packet-too-large.html" rel="nofollow">dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/packet-too-large.html</a>.

Not really.. I&#39;m just using a separate logger instance from the framework
@joHN Because inside of double quotes \ is used to escape special characters (like <code>\n</code> for a newline as an example). So you have to escape the slash (by adding the second &#41; so that PHP treats it as a literal slash. Honestly, a better approach is to simply encase strings with single quotes unless you need the additional functionality you get from double quotes. So in short, you can use <code>&#47;\s&#47;</code> as long as you encase it in single quotes like <code>preg_match(&#39;&#47;\s&#47;&#39;, $myString)</code>
thanks a lot :)
Hey, <i>Magneto</i>, Yet too much <code>join</code> &amp; <code>union</code>. By the way, +1 for recursive <code>CTE</code>.

In the conditional loop, it checks that the value stored in key 0 doesn&#39;t already exist. If the key (email) that matched the user email did exist in both places, then it would stop the program.

i even removed the value = old(&#39;name index ) thing but still the same error.
No idea. . . .. .. ..
@th3an0maly: Can you run in out in a terminal? (<code>python file.py</code> ?) I am certain you&#39;d see the behaviour there..
Initially question was &quot;how to replace characters in a string&quot;, which explains this answer.
It didn&#39;t.  I officially have no idea what&#39;s going wrong with your bot.  You didn&#39;t post a clear problem statement, you didn&#39;t post any code, and you don&#39;t appear to have read the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tour">tour</a>, especially where it describes <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">how to ask a good question</a> and how to write a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>.  I tried and failed to psychically deduce the problem you&#39;re having.  If you want any further help, you&#39;re going to have to post a question that can be answered.

you can not insert <code>null</code> as id! Also a comma is missing after `&#39;$user&#39;&#180;
I&#39;m using Microsoft&#39;s API Explorer with the key they generated and only receiving 401s. I think this is an issue on Microsoft&#39;s side.
The reason it&#39;s not a simple BFS algorithm is that we often have to recolor rooms. Consider the input set: <code>const vector&lt;char&gt; rooms = {0b1110, 0b1110, 0b1001, 0b0011}</code> and <code>const size_t width = 2U</code> In this case the second room would initially be colored with a separate color than the first room, but should subsequently be recolored with the same color as first room. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a way to do this in <i>O(n)</i>, but I&#39;d love to see an actual coding attempt!
How did you figure out it was for that reason?
@johndoe253, try the updated code now. You can adjust the parameters you want to retrieve from the original string by modifying the value 2 when calling the <code>Function FindWord(Source As String, Position As Integer)</code>
Hmm. True: <code>Error: expecting a single value</code> At least it doesn&#39;t return incorrect values. Will add caveat above.

I guess you can take a look to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html" rel="nofollow"><code>threading</code></a> library from the standard collection.

On the site they specify the dot because they are using router.navigate which is what they use throughout their heroes samples which is good because it forces you to start from the beginning and work up a history. But in some cases where you want the user to be able to directly travel to a particular path then you&#39;d have to use <code>&#47;</code>
Worked like a charm.  Thanks!

I updated the code and when I press on either button the third button doesnt show up.
ok @nerdylist I will show my work.
you could set the color indexes to variables and then in your condition code just say myCell.Interior.ColorIndex = variable1. Or you could say myCell.Interior.ColorIndex = myCell2.Interior.ColorIndex to match it with another cell&#39;s color
I doubt this compiles.

It works very well but i got a new little problem, i think easy to solve. I updated the main post
Yep. You need the double quotes around the String you need to exclude.
<code>type(i)</code> gives <code>&lt;class &#39;adodbapi.apibase.SQLrow&#39;&gt;</code>, and I get the same exact error both times
Create another array with 20 entries as followed: a. Use Math.random() method to generate numbers between zero and 20 to populate each entry of your array (hint: loop). b. Sort the entries in this array from lowest to highest array.sort(function(a, b){return a-b}); 6. Display values of each array on a separate paragraph ( &lt;p &gt; &lt;/p&gt; ).
@MuneebZulfiqar does it support JSON Schema? I&#39;m not finding that support if it&#39;s there.
If the returned data size is small, it is easier to use a modifier in the query. If not, then, in my opinion, it is better to add a new property, where the value is stored in uppercase (or lowercase) and be sure to create index on this property.
@rasclatt I don&#39;t think there is any real error, it seems to just make my page load shorter than it should. I will check the console.
@jezrael well it is more pythonic becaues &#39;explicit is better than implicit&#39; but my understanding is that pandas will infer the merge keys. EDIT: <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html#database-style-dataframe-joining-merging" rel="nofollow">The documents confirm this</a> &quot;<code>on:</code> If not passed and <code>left_index</code> and <code>right_index</code> are <code>False</code>, the intersection of the columns in the DataFrames will be inferred to be the join keys&quot;

Late comment: I&#39;d think that setting something like the text for a button to a simple variable or function makes more sense in the markup than in the code behind. Especially if you have many buttons set with text=&quot;literal&quot;, but one or two need some code, it&#39;s annoying that most are set in the markup but the exceptions are in the code behind. Now I not only have to look in two places to see the text values, but I have to search to find the place in the code behind. I certainly wouldn&#39;t put ten pages of code in the markup, but a simple &quot;text=&amp;lt;%=foo.bar%&amp;gt; seems very useful. Whatever.
One last thing. If I choose to do as you&#39;ve shown (option 1) where exactly would I place that code?

Do shape names ever get referenced in XLANG or code? As in, do they need to follow strict variable naming schemas? Or are they for display only, and can be descriptive like your example without ill effect? &quot;Increment Loop Counter&quot;

thanks for your answer, i think u are right, but its also not working with 2 brackets. other polygons are also stored with 3 brackets.. strange. i also checked start and endpoint -&gt; its the same. i am inserting this polygon using PHPmongoDB .. no error occurs, but its also not in the collection :(
That would mean one/page life cycle. If n users are loading the same page at the same time, that would be n values for that page. The problem is that the value of Session should be emptied. I still stick to the Page property idea as the best so far, but I hope there are more elegant ways. For now I will implement that one.

I&#39;m not sure why you have the footer-bar wrapped in an ion-content section, but you shouldn&#39;t need that. Can you also post all your $stateProvider code?
@Cameron637 that is the code that I&#39;ve tried. It doesn&#39;t change anything. Obviously, I&#39;m doing something wrong but not sure what. The point is to copy the path in &lt;img src=&quot;path/to/img&quot;&gt; in its parent &lt;a&gt; as &lt;a data-largesrc=&quot;path/to/img&quot;&gt;
You can log the value of <code>extra_hosts</code> in your recipe code via a log resource.

@user1881587: since you are relying on a private undocumented API, you are responsible for validating that API on every new release and make adjustments to your code accordingly. There is no guarantee that exported ordinals will not change from one release to the next.  Public DLL exports should be exported by name to avoid this problem.
I&#39;m confused... Is that your desired output? Are you looking to insert a row at a desired location or get multiple names for each column?

Okay @DavidArenburg . step by step. returns of ABC is dependent variable and returns of Bench is independent variable on day1. returns of ABC is dependent variable and returns of Bench is independent variable on day 2. returns of XYZ  is dependent variable and returns of Bench is independent variable on day1. returns of XYZ is dependent variable and returns of Bench is independent variable on day 2. Have I made myself clear?
It works! Thanks :) Could You explain it to me step by step? I would like to understand it for the future.
Indeed, a downgrade fixed this. I scared away from downgrading as I am not very familiar with Linux / Ubuntu yet and I only found the way to do it with the tar before, but with synaptic it&#39;s been very easy.
<code>accum</code> is a val.  It can&#39;t be modified.
Yes I have this line : &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE&quot; /&gt;
So most of your code has to be in a while loop- for every loop, you&#39;ll want to generate numbers, display the problem, get input, check correctness. If it&#39;s correct, you&#39;ll need to increment a counter; otherwise you&#39;ll break from the loop and print the number of corrects. Code edited to show- you&#39;ll have to add the ending print statement.
That helped a lot. Thanks. I can only accept the answer but not upvote. Sorry about that.

I tried turning the firewall off so that it can have access to remote connections. A solution told me to do so
Happy to help, not sure why are you getting down votes. It will help if instead of a link to an image, you post the relevant parts on your <code>routes.rb</code> file in the question text instead.
The <code>storeData()</code> is used to change the null value to default value, like if user put it blank , then it will save the value as 0.
@estus: Ok I get it that hack is for triggering Angular digest cycle (which I did manually). I still don&#39;t understand why it is not working with return. In the link you say &quot;Chai as Promised&#39;s assertions are regular Chai assertion objects, extended with a single then method derived from the input promise&quot;. This bit I do not understand, does that mean Angular q$ promises are not compliant ? It has a then function, Does Chai not wrap it ?
Get rid of the <code>&quot;&#39;&quot;</code> and use <code>.data()</code> instead
@Pran Have you tried it? <code>IGNORE NULLS</code> will... well I think you can guess...
How does this solve the problem?  For example, click in the latin text area.  This should toggle the tooltip off.  However it does not.

@LouisWasserman I wondered why there would be a problem with reducing with concat, given that the operation is associative. But then I read the javadoc and indeed found a &quot;technical issue&quot; warning: <i>Use caution when constructing streams from repeated concatenation. Accessing an element of a deeply concatenated stream can result in deep call chains, or even StackOverflowException.</i> I guess the last alternative is not only the most elegant one, but also the most robust one then.
I&#39;m learning WPF and amazed at how difficult it makes some minor tasks. Having to reference the API DLLs just to set a window position is ridiculous.

jewelsea, subject to mentioned numbers (15 sessions/ per day * 15 records / per session* 180 days = 40K records)  - does it make difference which embedded DB  to chose? I m inclining to Derby because it has more tutorials as far as I see
Please verify, it should work for any length now.
I think I&#39;m confused -- for the first method using <code>import csv</code>, seems like that&#39;s going to be a resource hog. And also, I don&#39;t know how to get that to search through every row in my initial dataframe.  And for merge -- I&#39;m looking at the documentation, and I&#39;m not sure that this is doing what I want it to do? There will be multiple records in the CSV file that share the same ZIP code -- should a merge work even if that&#39;s the case? And also, since there will be some ZIP codes in the original database that don&#39;t match with the CSV file, will it create thousands of extraneous rows?
Is it clearer now?
perhaps you can try to allow only portrait mode when entering background, so that it at least wouldn&#39;t generate distorted snapshot ... but i think this is a good question, and hope somebody else could offer some insights

@Tim-Williams <code>.GetRows(0, 0)</code> returns the &quot;Wrong number of arguments&quot; error.

Though, something still doesn&#39;t quite make sense.  Why would you try turning the firewall off to see which SQL Server you connected to in SSMS?  It just seems like a really odd thing to try.  I&#39;m curious - do you have a specific SQL Server you&#39;re trying to access?
Could you answer on my questions (see the previous comment)? For example, how many total items of data (invoices) you need to display in the grid.
Great edit! This definitely helped me piece things together. With your example, I now see that anything that is defined at the Orchestration level OR the ___Scope level (if I&#39;m inside that scope) is available to an Expression/MessageAssignment shape via XLANG. That helps quite a bit! Thanks!

@chux Good point. That works aswell.
This works great. Except, it doesn&#39;t delete branches with the word &#39;master&#39; in their name. (e.g. master-TRIAG-873). I&#39;ve tried the solution below (<code>grep -v &#39;^  master$&#39;</code>), but that still includes the actual master branch when I try it.
I&#39;m starting to think more and more that it&#39;s the user the job is running under.

Yes the downvote is probably due to your question being unclear.  Try and address the issues raised by Dan and I and edit your question to be clearer.
@AndrewMorton No, they get replaced by the app, which I tried to clarify in the question.
In input tag you can also specify name attribute then you get vars data after submission of form.
(Meant ARC, sorry!) Doesn&#39;t matter, was just trying to understand if there was a significant difference between this and the accepted answer - notably the use of <code>seconds(1)</code>. Keep it here, certainly don&#39;t mind ;)
@MosesKoledoye What would be the best approach in solving that?
@JCDJulian: Create a custom theme that is based on an existing dialog theme (e.g., <code>Theme.Material.Dialog</code>) and ties in with the rest of your app&#39;s theme. So, for example, if you are using <code>appcompat-v7</code> and <code>Theme.AppCompat</code>, you would use <code>Theme.AppCompat.Dialog</code> or something. Mostly what it does is say that your activity&#39;s window is <code>wrap_content</code>/<code>wrap_content</code> with respect to your content view, as opposed to filling the available screen space.
Please include your <code>pom.xml</code>, and anything else you think would be useful for us to analyze the issue. There may be something missing and I cannot tell without knowing more detail.
Sadly doesn&#39;t help - what gives you the error - I&#39;m just using the same lines you use in your own code. What&#39;s your new code - and what line gives you the error and what is the error message. You can help us help you
Yeah, you can import it with<code>importScripts()</code>, which is a service worker thing. For a working example (albeit with a lot of other stuff going on), you should check out the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ioweb2016" rel="nofollow">Google I/O web app</a> source code.

Thank you Andrei. I believe this is very close. I still receive the following error however with your proposed solution: &#39;Additional information: The process cannot access the file &#39;C:\Users....\Desktop\C# Test\Results\newtest.docx&#39; because it is being used by another process.&#39;    This issue is, I believe, that the file is already open when it is passed to this method. This is why we created the stream in the first place. Do you see a way that the stream can be incorporated into your solution?
Just saw you updated your comment. The square brackets stuff indicates optional portions of the statement. Looks like you might want to review MySQL syntaxes and do a couple practice DELETEs on another test database before doing something like this.
Connect to the Mongo Shell. Your database is called &quot;test&quot; right? And your collection is &quot;users&quot;? If so, then run <code>use test</code> and then <code>db.users.dropIndex({&quot;name&quot;: -1})</code> to make sure you&#39;ve removed the index.

Hi @PredragStojadinović, I have found the same issue. With onRendered it was simply not working. I am using a sequence of collection.find calls and updating the DOM with jquery. With rendered it was working beautifully. I then found my mistake... I had chnaged to Template.name.onRendered = function () { ..... }  , only changing rendered for onRendered, instead of using it as a callback like Template.name.onRendered(function(){ ..... }) . Not using &quot;=&quot;. After correcting it, it started working fine.
I&#39;m not going to get baited into accidentally deleting a bunch of data from your database. This is not the &quot;exact&quot; command. This is the reference manual&#39;s explanation of how the DELETE command works. I have no idea what your WHERE or ORDER BY statements will be. Usually people will build a SELECT statement to query the data they want to delete then modify the SELECT command to match the DELETE syntax. You would simply be adding the LIMIT clause as well as it is not a very common operation from my experience.
Pretty sure it does work otherwise the Android SDK is broken. We have no idea what your <code>storeData()</code> method does. You also show how you are trying to get it.

@kiong - how? show some code please.
To clarify, you are dropping the database AND removing unique: true from your mongoose schema right? Do you have any other Mongoose schema&#39;s that could be interfering (i.e. same collection name)? Because your error references &quot; test.users.$name_1 &quot;, that makes me think the same index keeps being created, on the name field.So, you have an index on the name field, and but you aren&#39;t using the name field anymore--you changed it to username--so every username/password you enter has {name: null}, which fails on the unique index.
@JohnBode No , I&#39;m not. You are right. I removed it. But it still does not work properly..

There isn&#39;t much you can do. You can wrap it in a component but using a custom component as form input fields (with <code>[(ngModel)]=&quot;...&quot;</code>) isn&#39;t trivial either.

@ncohen, I actually thought that the <code>myArr.length-1</code> was a mistake in your code. But if that is intentional, then what you want is impossible. The arrays occupy two different array locations. You cannot define them (in JavaScript) as one being a part of the other. So your solution should be to write a custom function that performs the <code>splice</code> on both arrays, and you never call <code>splice</code> directly, but use that function.

Now that the code is on a branch, you normally finish the work there.  So you can periodically &quot;sync&quot; branch with trunk by doing a full merge to your branch.  When you are all done, just have an updated working copy from trunk and merge the branch back into it ... review and commit.

By NAs, I mean NAs :) Try <code>df3 = data.table(group = c(NA,2L,1L),value3 = rnorm(3),key = &quot;group&quot;)</code> or with <code>df3 = data.table(group = c(3L,2L,1L),value3 = rnorm(3),key = &quot;group&quot;)[2, value3 := NA]</code>. Both of these lead to an error with your first approach on my computer.
Not only does console throw an error, it also shows from which urls it tried to download these files. So you can investigate the console a little bit and fix your code appropriately.

Think how you are going to manage database changes etc. Are you going to use EF migrations or have a DBA control the changes. Also, how you are going to keep all your applications up to date. Finally, how you are going to roll new versions of applications and database in production so that nothing breaks (not strictly CodeFirst/DbFirst question but still worth thinking about). Working with EF migrations in larger team has some issues. If you do DbFirst with edmx/csdl/ssdl/msl merges to these files can be the issue. Also if you customize model (csdl) updates db you will overwrite your model.

@musiphil thanks for pointing that out! I had fixed it in the benchmark code, but forgot to update the answer.
Glad this helps. I guess you could try upgrading to another version of Windows 10 and it should be fixed for good.
But the instance can never enter the <code>deinit</code> until there are no strong references left to it (as managed by ARC). And the timer will keep a strong reference to it as long as it&#39;s running – once the timer is invalidated, the target selector cannot be called by it. So I don&#39;t see how the situation you&#39;re describing could arise, although I might be overlooking something.
I manged to both keep the identifier column and append the labels. The problem was that the labels came back unstacked. Needed to stack them, and, drop the dimensions columns and bring it back to the identifier column. To keep the index indtact, I had to call dropna before separating out the the identifier colmun leaving only the dimensions. I am sure it is a cleaner way of setting this up, but this works for now.

Well, the strings are different. <code>fonts&#47;weathericons-regular-webfont.ttf</code> is not the same as <code>fonts&#47;fontawesome-webfont.ttf</code>. Perhaps your problem is not in your static string, but rather with the font itself.

You should use colgroup for irregular headers.  How is this an irregular header? You have one colgroup of 3 columns, and then every tbody tr is 3 td&#39;s each.  That&#39;s regular. See: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/irregular/" rel="nofollow">w3.org/WAI/tutorials/tables/irregular</a> for examples of tables with irregular headers.

Move the first three, non-comment, lines in the <code>ForEach</code> loop to outside before you enter the loop; then move the last two lines in the <code>ForEach</code> loop outside after you exit the loop.

You only want one ComObject you don&#39;t want to be recreating it everytime.

@DavidPinchen there are few <code>println</code> methods. One of them is <code>println(char[] array)</code> and other is <code>print(Object)</code>. When you call <code>print(&quot;foo&quot;+someCharArray)</code> then compiler see it as <code>print(&quot;foo&quot;+someCharArray.toString())</code> so it first will invoke <code>toString</code> from array (which will create <code>[C@1540e19d</code> since this is implementation which each array inherits from Object) and then it will concatenate it with <code>foo</code> and print result. If you invoke <code>print(someCharArray)</code> then instead of <code>println(Object)</code> <code>println(char[] array)</code> will be invoked which simply prints each character in array.

I did not suggest getting rid of the <code>for</code> loop in which you create the children.  I suggested moving the code that closes all the pipe ends the parent doesn&#39;t need outside.  The <code>if (i == 0)</code> of course conditions the <code>close(pp[0][0])</code>, but only that.  The inner loop over <code>j</code> is executed for every <code>i</code>.  Since only the parent ever exits the loop, it would be much cleaner and less susceptible to error to simply handle the parent&#39;s pipe ends outside the loop.

Well, I guess you&#39;re not interested in a data.table answer (since I already mentioned one in chat)? A dplyr analogue is <code>iris %&gt;% filter(duplicated(.[2:4])) %&gt;% arrange(Sepal.Length)</code>
@Vicky If you are going to use my example as reference, might as well accept it as the answer. Or is there something I did not cover?
Another update it appears that &quot;product&quot; variable in this query is being ignored by mongoose.

Why do you keep adding and removing those two dots, form a line which shouldn&#39;t really be there anyway? Are you just trying to artificially bump your question repeatedly on to the front page?
if you want only the item_models that have posts you have to use the Has method, like this..      $posts = Item_model::has(&#39;posts&#39;)-&gt;where(&#39;model_name&#39;, &#39;LIKE&#39;, $q . &#39;%&#39;)-&gt;get();

<code>LangDetector langDetector = new LangDetector();</code> However I would recommend starting off with a tutorial on Java if this is tripping you up as you will likely run into other errors.

Excellent. Personally I think this is better than the accepted answer, I prefer <code>eog</code> also.

Also, @Rafael_Espericueta - if I had to guess, the PIL developers probably preferred bringing up <code>ImageMagick</code>, since it&#39;s got editing capabilities, unlike <code>eog</code>. After all, <i>image.show()</i> was &quot;mainly intended for debugging purposes.&quot;

While the original question was about &quot;nullable&quot; floats and ints, I think this response is the best advice. You can probably bake the handling of 2 or 4 values into the object model and make it clean. If you allow nullable values, now you open yourself up to 16 possible combinations (2**4) when in reality, you only want 2 possible combinations. What do you do if <code>a1</code> is nulled, or <code>a2</code> is nulled but not <code>b2</code>?
Thanks Danny, this works. Have one follow up if you know. I was using TIMESTAMP to convert an epoch long into a human readable date, but that doesn&#39;t work in standard. Is there a way to achieve the same effect?

you can cancelAllOperations in your operationQueue before adding any new blockOperation:      [operationQueue cancelAllOperations];     [operationQueue addOperation:myblockOperation];
@tadman Yeah, I thought about it (though I doubt it could be any faster,) but I on purpose made this answer as cryptic as possible.

Maybe the user you are trying to use does not have permissions to see some of the tables and therefore they appear to be &quot;missing&quot;. To verify, connect to the database using the same credentials and try selecting/using the table EF is complaining about.

Looks like a good way forward.  What about disabling it when going outside the proxy?  Found that the vagrant plugin punched the guest linux in multiple places to make various different tools/apps work.  Is there a simple way to disable?

A* finds the same perfect paths as Dijkstra&#39;s Algorithm as long as the heuristic is consistent and doesn&#39;t overestimate.

@user3284178 You&#39;re encountering a similar problem: you&#39;re trying to assign a pointer. You should use something like this: <code>std::copy(name.begin(), name.end(), divisionData.divisionName)</code>. Note that in this case, you&#39;ll need to make sure that you do proper bounds checking.

I had the opposite requirement in a project, show UTC and my solution was to create my own <code>UtcDateSelectInput</code>, this was for <code>Formtastic</code>, but a similar/analog solution should work with simple_form.

This question might attract a lot of opinion-based responses, so be careful. In terms of avoiding communicating with the server, you can do local caching. If you <i>need</i> to poll the server for updates, there&#39;s no way around that, and the best you can do is minimize the update size/frequency where possible.

Changing <code>innerHTML</code> of a div won&#39;t trigger <code>onload</code> on that div, no matter what is the added content. <code>onload</code> is fired only on elements which themselves load some external resources (like <code>img</code> and <code>iframe</code>). You could simply call <code>init</code> after setting <code>innerHTML</code> of the div.

It IS possible with Javascript, if you use SessionStorage (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage" rel="nofollow">click here</a>). Using a server-sided language like PHP can also work (with <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.session.php" rel="nofollow">sessions</a>).

@originaluser2 Good to hear that, I image those high-level language should automatically handle those stuff. But I did have crashes before when I didn&#39;t deinit the repeated timer, and it cost me lots of time to debug.

The GetUIObjectOf does make a call to create context menu (the same one that CreateViewObject does), however it does not get called in this case.

Yes of course you can do this. Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS). Every machine has its own local database and most of the commands are executed locally. All you need is to let your friends know your IP address and they can clone/fetch (and do whatever they do with a remote repo) using ssh for example. They can add your repo as a remote with <code>git remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt;</code> then they can start fetching, pulling and pushing to your repo.

This is incorrect. First you have misspelled your variable, second it should be more or equal to 9.
@JuanCarlosOropeza Added in some more explanation.

What exactly are you trying to do? And why? That will help me understand what you might be able to do.

You got that error because you were duplicating: _fts, and _ftsx--the keys in your index by leaving them blank.  try adding:  db.test1.createIndex({&quot;name&quot;:1, &quot;lname&quot;:1}, {unique: true});  also drop your text index and recreate it without enforcing uniqueness.
@Bradley the 1st 2 lines define which sheet the data is being pulled form (sourceSheet) and where is is being pasted (destSheet). the third line is definefining a variable named lMaxRows as the last used row in the desination sheet. the last line is then saying make the cell in column A in the row after the last used row on the destination have the same value as the cell M1 in the source sheet.
Thank you for your comments.   @Anthony: No, I haven&#39;t taken the log of my dependent variable (in the examples, I have been working through people used logEstimate = lm(y ~ log(x))).
Just a warning, you want to use &quot;quiet&quot; NaNs, otherwise setting it to NaN could raise a floating point exception. If you don&#39;t know if you have quiet NaNs or not, then you should not use NaNs.

@user596502 I edited the snippet to work with remote data. Now when you type the component displays the suggestions.
sorry I totally forgot to get back to your answer. I ended up using a database table for storing session variables in a Key-Value pair fashion. As an identifier I didn&#39;t use the session&#39;s UID but the ID of the logged in user, which I store in a Claim with Type NameIdentifier. Not perfect, but it serves my purpose.
Although you only need to access the data, not the component. Personally I would store the data outside of the React component and pass in a array reference to it. That way you can update the array from where ever you like. Checkout Redux for the best solution.

I would be extremely suspicious of the <code>Stream::concat</code> code.  I would say you&#39;re not really intended to use <code>concat</code> like that.
In addition to that I mentioned above, it might also be good to know more about your installation, for example if you installed additional plugins into STS or if this happens with a vanilla STS 3.7.3 distribution.
this XML is probably for your <code>Fragment</code>... and for <code>Activity</code>?
@cosmix updated. Thanks!
@alk Thanks for all of your help!
The cancel button should only be on the right if the other option is a destructive action, in which case you should use <code>UIAlertActionStyleDestructive</code> for that action.  Having it on the left is the correct behavior when the right side is <code>UIAlertActionStyleDefault</code>

Please reduce the max heap setting to something around 2GB in your setting. I would definitely not recommend to use more than that. In addition to that I would suggest to raise an issue at <a href="https://issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS" rel="nofollow">issuetracker.springsource.com/browse/STS</a>, so that we can analyze in detail what is causing this issue for you. We need your help a bit in investigating this. Would be good to capture thread dumps while STS hangs (or is taking a long time for something) and attach them to the bug report. I am sure we will figure out what is going wrong there.
The timer will keep the target retained as long as it&#39;s active, so even if you have no references to the given target – the timer does. This is exactly, as you say, to prevent issues that could be caused by attempting to call a method on a deallocat(ed/ing) object. If you&#39;re looking for a way to avoid this behaviour, then take a look at <code>CFRunLoopTimer</code> – which can take a closure as a callback instead of a target and selector.
@FirstStep No, the first statement sounds wrong. The second could be correct. The &quot;temporary&quot; may never happen.

@hotspring, It seems the issues are in line 36 and line 39 of CustomPresenter.cs, which needs to use the ViewModel type i.e. <code>ThirdViewModel</code> not <code>ThirdFragment</code> .

You can do this on line 43 replacing <code>MvxFragmentsPresenter</code> with your custom presenter type <code>CustomPresenter</code>.

P.S. Note that it would only work if you add a UNIQUE constraint to your UniqueKey column. To be actually able to add this constraint, the UniqueKey values should be unique in the first place. You can achieve that by the following query (executed just once):  <code>UPDATE pictures SET UniqueKey = id</code> Assuming id is your primary key.

what are the check to be made to run eclipse on my system, please assit.
My updated_at values are not unique to each id though. They are simply timestamp values, and my objective is to remove the oldest duplicate.
I tried removing the comma before and it didnt work at all :s
PLEASE CHECK AGAIN
As the other comment said, what are you looking for? Your current main method reads a a line, detects it using the library, and prints out the result. Are you looking to move this logic to a separate class, to have your program do this continuously, or what?
Yup, the &quot;/Zc:rvalueCast&quot; solves the problem. To future readers you can set that in your project by going to your &quot;Property Pages&quot; &gt; &quot;Configuration Properties&quot; &gt; &quot;C/C++&quot; &gt; &quot;Command Line&quot; and enter &quot;/Zc:rvalueCast&quot; under &quot;Additional Options&quot;
this actually did the trick for me! :)
The main reason why  we redirect after post is to prevent user hitting refresh button and sending you the same data again.
The rule looks fine, it might be that the rewrite module is not available in the http server.
yup thanks! @codeomnitrix
The JDK is the Java SE version - not the same thing. The issue is which version of the Java EE contract (API) is implemented by the server you are using?
&quot;And from your comment replies, it seems your actual question is something else entirely. If you want to retain the value of a drop-down list AFTER having left the page, you will need to store the value somewhere (most commonly a cookie, SessionStorage or a server-side session which is outside of the scope of Javascript).&quot;   Meaning I can&#39;t possibly make the drop down menu stay on what was selected using javascript?
The code you&#39;ve posted provides a main class that <i>does exactly what you want to do.</i>
DRapp...perhaps you might have a suggestion for this as well. I left off part of the table I have for my parlays table as I didn&#39;t find it necessary for the logic, but now I am unsure how to implement it.  I have a single wager and single odds that are for a parlay, not for the individual games as part of the parlay. Do you know how I could implement these? Perhaps I need to add another table with that information?
So when the form is submitted would I loop through the array of areas in my controller to make a new entry for each area in update_info_areas? Is there a better way to handle the  array passed to the controller from the form?
I want to avoid having to set the UserService directly. Using reflection with Whitebox did the trick though, thanks!
Already did. But the error is same.
I can&#39;t put here the code, if I paste here the code is shows very ugly. Can I send you the code on Skype ? :D
@TheBeardedLlama thanks for the suggestion, I tried it but it does the same thing.

Thank you for your answer and patient. I have modified my question. I only find psql in /usr/local/bin/ path, and I did not find anything related to psql under /etc path. Thanks!
@KubaOber the code is complementary to Puppy&#39;s example. The flags are global <code>bool</code>s with no qualifiers. Obviously, if the flags were declared as <code>std::atomic&lt;bool&gt;</code>, then there would be no issue. This example is demonstrating the problem that arises from using a simple non-atomic flag without proper synchronization. Unless I&#39;m mistaken, using <code>t.join()</code> would be very wrong if the thread was detached. Anyway, I changed my example to use join instead, to demonstrate that it makes no difference to this problem. I also added volatile qualifiers to demonstrate that they make no difference.

@RickRunowski I have attached a screenshot. I do not see any build action menu.
@Jim, you should still should be able to make flexible format strings using the code above. If you use variables in place of the <code>-8</code> you can grab however many digits/characters you like from the back without using string indexing. Sorry if I&#39;m misunderstanding the problem

This is no different from using &quot;\r&quot; or &quot;\r\n&quot; which the OP said he tried.

I wouldn&#39;t do it the way you&#39;re doing it in general, but given the control you want over your long running task, using your own <code>Thread</code> is definitely advisable.

Your welcome:)   I hate how every question gets down votes for arbitrary reasons. Your question was valid.

Sometimes getting general knowledge requires asking general questions.
Sure you can, just at the appropriate <code>export</code> statement to your <code>.bashrc</code>
Yes, hadoop fs -ls -R &lt;path&gt; works. Get the files enumerated. Somehow listFileStatus doesn&#39;t seem to recognize this same path.

You&#39;ll need to include the filename at the end like <code>C:\sfmlprojects\sfmlpong\sfmlpong\[filename]</code>. If that doesn&#39;t work perhaps the problem is caused by the font file itself... Does the font format match one of the ones listed in the documentation for <code>font::loadfromfile</code>? Have you tried loading a different font?

The same issue as before if running it from cmd.exe. New finding is that, it does not show the command, but if hit ctrl+enter after typing in some thing, it can say like &#39;ls command not found&#39;. So I am thinking maybe some terminal setting or keyboard binding is not correct now.

The problem is I don&#39;t have control over what hash actually contains... sometime it might be a 40 char hash... in other cases it might be 10 digit version string... I can somewhat choose what to replace within the format string, but note it&#39;s not always the same structure.

@Compass - we are currently discussing those exact questions and the big question that comes up is &quot;What does everyone else do?&quot; I&#39;m suggesting only caching when the database is unavailable but there is no telling how long that could be.

As you see, the CPU compatibility is the downside of that approach: I was really disappointed when I’ve realized for the last decade there’s no longer such thing as x86 instruction set, Intel/AMD has diverged. Looks like I can only rely on SSE 4.1 and below, and they’re 9 years old already…

No i don&#39;t want to narrow the list of items in the listView but to narrow the number of items to be colored. If i type only F it will color almost all the items since the letter F might be exist in many of the items text. But if i will keep typing Form1 then it will narrow the number of items to be colored. Not narrow the number of items. The idea is just to search in the items not to remove them .

Thanks for your input.  Yes, building with visual studio.  It’s not the compiler emitting those instructions. I’ve vectorized my code manually using intrinsics. AFAIR it became about two times faster compared to automatic vectorization to AVX2: my algorithms mostly process integer numbers / bit masks, gigabytes of them, and I’ve coded a lot of bit tricks processing those __m128i values. I don’t believe automatic vectorization is capable of doing optimizations comparable to what I did here.

The images range in size from roughly 1MP to 5MP - it depends on the camera.  This, of course, will only increase with time.  On the CPU in my machine I can perform the convolution on a 1MP image in under 0.1s, which is sufficient for now.  By the time this code becomes performance limiting as it is, we would end up wanting to port it to a GPU instead, which can do thousands of MP per second vs, say, dozens.

Then does it matter what you call it as long as you store than property name in a variable for later reference (if you&#39;re needing to know you&#39;ve reached this specific property name)?
After clarification, this question isn&#39;t about constraints at all, even though that&#39;s what was initially stated
This came from the line: for(var el of this){
So, <code>Loaded</code> is the last stop before rendering, yet <code>Activated</code> occurs when the window is brought into the foreground and before <code>Loaded</code>. That suggests the window is brought to the foreground before it&#39;s rendered. And that&#39;s why I find this a little confusing.
Can you tell about the reason why would you want to render components outside of the render function?
If this is for formatting output, you might be better off performing the simpler query, and constructing the displayed tables manually.
excuse me, i found the cause for the error. there was one small section of the code that i thought is not relevant to this error. i deleted it and the error disappered. thank you
You&#39;d probably be better off using parameterized queries.
I really need that (string id) there, How can I incorporate that into my code?
@user2224135 you only need one of the two ways! <code>ToArray</code> is a linq extension. maybe you missed a reference or need to use <code>Values.OfType&lt;Parameter&gt;().ToArray()</code>
Windows XP supports .Net 4, but <i>nothing</i> above that, not even 4.0.3 - I&#39;ve just found this out the hard way.

@AnoE: Oh, I see, so it does!  Thanks.
its works, thanks but I was wondering why style are (UIAlertActionStyleDefault) same for both alert actions? I was trying UIAlertActionStyleDefault and second one UIAlertActionStyleCance l!!!
@Rayon can you be more explicit?
And don&#39;t forget to remove the class when <code>mouseleave</code>
Alternatively and for more flexibility, use <code>.html()</code>. A <code>$.trim()</code> operation might also be used.
@W.F. I agree. This is where <code>std::forward_as_tuple()</code> can be used.
I already use it but can you show me how can i calculate collectionview height in delegate?
Also, if you use the <code>inverse_of</code> method, it should be <code>validates_presence_of :contact</code> (<i>not</i> <code>:contact_id</code>.)
I get now : Uncaught TypeError: this[Symbol.iterator] is not a function
I didn&#39;t know about regexhero, great stuff, thanks!

@ toolic : Yes I would like to retain the blank lines without getting N and P beside them.
Why does there have to be a way to do it?  There is no reason Xamarin&#39;s tooling can&#39;t just consume XAML without being able to write it.  What&#39;s the use case for needing to generate XAML from code?  If you&#39;re comfortable writing your UI in code that&#39;s perfectly acceptable.  XAML is just an alternate way to do it.
@ZheyuanLi - Ah, my mistake. Thanks for clearing that up.
I&#39;m sorry. I posted a cleaner file structure. Thank you for taking a look.
@MarkPlotnick:  The IAR compiler is not supporting message catalogs; but the concept seems to be the same as a <i>getter</i> function.
@Aurimas; That is actually pretty good solution because after initialization (just once), you will not need to use any logical operations to determine your value.
or use .jpg images for stacking them along z axis? my temperature, elevation, winds data was in text file from where i generate this images(chats). Now when i make some modiffications in your beautiful code, it stack three images as i want but all images background becomes <b>brown</b> which enable reader to even look at this 3d plot?

Well, I guess you are half right. By adding print(self), I confirmed there really are two instances, but I don&#39;t know why. There&#39;s no view with this custom view class on the nib, and when I removed the instanciation code to this view (now included in the question) there was no log from the custom view.  Maybe the init(coder:) is called from the addSubview of the scrollView?
it was in my question... it is supposed to allows to rotate, scale, move, skew
and doing that in xml smells like a a workaround / hack which not only will be harder to implement but also much more complex
No. Don&#39;t make any changes in the network architecture. In my opinion, you are overthinking about this issue. If you have 650 training samples, make batch size 50, 65 etc. On the other hand, drop one or two samples to make it divisible by batch size (example, 743 samples, its prime, so no batch size will help, so drop one sample, make it 742, that is divisible). Neural network performance won&#39;t be affected by one or ten samples more or less. If you have a dataset where removing 10 samples means removing 10% of the data, maybe you should think of some other method than neural networks.
@Rayon May you please elaborate on what you mean by that Rayon? Thank you!

We actually want both - resilience and decoupling. Currently we are dealing with exceptions from the connection being lost, and with delayed / stopped processing from the dao calls hanging while waiting for the timeout. As for the resilience, we don&#39;t want to require database fail over for our system to run. It is deployed to customer&#39;s sites and that would be  requirement that we couldn&#39;t guarantee.
What do you mean by <code>transaction</code>. Do you mean JPA Transaction?

something like <code>CASE  sum(x)  WHEN 0 then 0 else 1</code>?
Hey thank you so much for answer. Now I&#39;m a bit confused. I did that <code>for</code> (the one who makes the children) with the idea that the variable <code>i</code> was copied to the memory of children, so I can use it to recognice what children is it and use it when I read/write in the pipe (for example <code>pp[i][1]</code>). I think the father only close once the pipes with the <code>if(i==0)</code>, am I right? I&#39;m using that <code>for</code> too so I can create all the children.

Nice answer: minor question: Why use <code>if (res &lt;= 1 || res == EOF)</code> vs <code>if (res &lt;= 1)</code> or <code>if (res != 2)</code> or ...?  Some sort of clarity emphasizes?  Note: suggest <code>printf(&quot;Line %zu: %d %d\n&quot;, ...</code>

I think i found out the problem ... i had the client version of MySql workbench. and no server so i made it work by downloading the Server version of it  Thanks for your help anyway. It&#39;s mostly because i did not have a connection

That&#39;s kinda what I suspected. I seems to work, but it is all but obvious from the code what is happening.
Ok well we can get indexes if we have a values list. I have been thinking of that too as this is just a small data frame. Still working on it.
You&#39;re passing <code>$check_ip</code> (a string) to <code>mysqli_num_rows</code>.  You want to pass <code>$query1</code>.  (You probably also want <code>if( !$query1 ... )</code>
So if you copy and paste this code into notepad++ and open it up in a browser, my issue is when I select a different language for example Italian, what happens is it will take me to the link (the 1st function of javascript does that) but what happens is that the drop-down menu goes back to default (English US)
Now it gives me another error: <code>org.apache.commons.codec.DecoderException: Odd number of characters. 	at org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex.decodeHex(Hex.java:82)</code>

@Paparazzi - Thank you for the feedback - appreciated.

@S.Neum Using a getter gives you control over the reference itself. However, since you can change the contents of an array, it passes out a mutable object which can then be changed without your <code>GameOfLifeBoard</code> being aware of it. For example, an outside class could do this: <code>boolean[][] board = gol.getGameBoard(); board[0][0] = true;</code>. That would modify  the board but wouldn&#39;t give <code>GameOfLifeBoard</code> a chance to, for example, repaint itself to reflect the changes. It lets the class be modified without knowing it happened. Not really a problem in this case, but dangerous in general.

Note that the syntax for inline styles stands for <code>Your Format Title|format_id|icon</code>. For block styles you just don&#39;t have the icon. So that&#39;s different from Plone 4&#39;s tinymce.xml where you&#39;d specify <code>Your Format Title|tag|class</code>. That&#39;s why you need the additional JSON structure, there you define each format, keyed by its id.

Not sure what your folder structure is but try changing your base tag to &lt;base href=&quot;/&quot; /&gt; in your index.html. This tells the router the part that shouldn&#39;t change. I think your current location isn&#39;t pointing to the correct path.

Is there some logging or anything that would have pip print out the files it&#39;s trying to read and whether or not it was successful in doing so?
@Sig ah, sounded epic.
Thanks for your input.  As my treeview is large containing many datasets, it&#39;s probably not good to use setIndexWidget.  If I reimplement QStyledItemDelegate and change createEditor to set the editor depending on the QModelIndex index, how do i then set it for a specific child cell in my model?

Figured it out myself. Create a separate pom file to call the RPM plugin, and set a different distributionManagement element in it to upload to the RPM repo. This means there&#39;ll be 2 Maven calls in the build process - one to generate the jar/war artifacts, a second to call the RPM pom file. For the RPM pom, the expectation is the 1st Maven call has run and the jar/war artifacts are in a known location for packaging purposes.

It is because when you click on button, the button command is fired. And when you select the row, why do you expect the button command to fire?  It will not be fired. Do one thing. Create a data template trigger for PreviewMouseDown and handle for both button and row. It should do the work. Try and revert if any issues.
Unfortunately they thought of that too, but really great suggestion! I haven&#39;t thought of obfuscating in this manner before.

If the files don&#39;t change as you are saying, you don&#39;t need to add them to gitignore (they don&#39;t change!). Anyways, if they were tracked and then you added them to gitignore, git will not consider ignoring them until you run <code>git rm --cached</code> command, which <i>only</i> removes the files from the cache. Maybe you ran the command and forgot to add <code>--cached</code> option which results in deleting the file from the cache and the working directory (and adding the deletion action to index!)
Then use args[i] with I being the index of the item that you are looking for.

do-while would mean that this would happen at least once. So practically it does the following: generates a key, generates a query, executes an update query. If the update query breaks, it would most probably break because the key is a duplicate - i.e. already has been generated before and inserted for another id. Of course, it could break for other reasons - server down, etc. No matter why it breaks, mysqli_query() would return false. Then the do-while loop repeats - generates a new key and tries inserting it again.
Please make sure that you substitute <code>{MY KEY}</code> with your key, and make certain to remove the curly braces.
You might be trying to <code>var_dump($tv_one);</code>

Hey @Mohamad, the reason is, I have a search page, where user inputs date_from and date_to(with &lt;%= date_select f ... %&gt;), and then with that date I return all the items from db, created between that period. However, here I&#39;m thinking of a button &quot;Today&quot;, when you click (instead of selecting manually date_from, date_to), it will return all the items created today. Hope it explains what i need!
