@EdMorton you can suck it, too. Plus your downvotes mean nothing to me so feel free to downvote these nuts.
Don&#39;t call people liars here.
WTF. I spent like 4 hours on this crap for nothing
@joelgoldstick I created a dummy account to upvote my answer because these question moderating idiots don&#39;t want to answer it but downvote it instead.
Formatted the html code         I DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THIS YOU SAY
@PeterCordes You really expect me to listen to someone who doesn&#39;t even know how input/output operands work? <i>This</i> is a serious question.

@Andrew: A dumb way to go about what? It&#39;s not clear what you&#39;re criticising.
I dont think your thesis is good at all...
You gotta be a serious loser to down vote someone for asking a question..I could care less about my rank.  Just trying to get a question answered.

Go go go Iceland. England is out!

A downvote because you dislike rectangular selection? You gotta be kidding me. <i>*shakes head*</i>

@corvax: SO is like real life. Many people prefer sticking to their prejudices instead of getting informed.
Why don&#39;t you drink a coffee yourself?
Confusing people with 16k rep for downvotes, just SO things.
full of sooo many haters today! Jeez, just trying to help a guy out
Down down you go
So go learn up on basic concepts before you treat SO like a tutorial site for day 1 people on a topic.
I hate defacing o
you guys are fucking useless
You are obviously hitting a nerve - sign of a great question. Nerds get a little too religious about their environments. Blasphemy!

Someone with 11k rep should know some questions aren&#39;t worth answering...
I hate those who start to down vote like this!! As if they were born educated and full of knowledge, rather than down voting, tell him where his problem is/what mistake he did
@ziadeson I just said I am trying. Why can&#39;t you give some respect?
Well, the SO has gone to hell a long time ago. These days people downvote if they don&#39;t know the answer. If you ask dumb questions, then you get answers and upvotes.
man, someone is on a downvote spree this morning :P
@GillBates Why do they teach cooking at chef schools when you can just go to a restaurant? Why do people learn how to drive cars when you can just Uber? Why do schools teach reading when there are audiobooks?
For those who are wondering: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4liLpYA.png" rel="nofollow">Why the hell kebab?</a>
Clearly it needs to grow up and learn some responsibility. Kick it out of the house and let it get its own apartment at the very least.
